# Project Context for jsavrs

## Project Overview

**jsavrs** is a sophisticated, high-performance Rust-based OS-independent compiler/transpiler written in Rust. It's designed to take source code written in a custom language (with `.vn` file extension) and compile it through multiple phases: lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, intermediate representation (IR) generation, and finally assembly code generation. The project leverages Rust's safety and performance features to provide a robust and efficient compilation framework.

### Architecture & Components

The project follows a classic compiler architecture with distinct phases:

1. **Lexer** (`src/lexer.rs`): Uses the `logos` crate to tokenize input source code. Handles character scanning, token recognition, and error reporting with line/column tracking.

2. **Parser** (`src/parser/`): Implements a Pratt parser for handling expressions with proper precedence. Converts tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with error recovery capabilities and recursion depth limits.

3. **Semantic Analysis** (`src/semantic/type_checker.rs`): Performs type checking, symbol table management, and validation of the AST. Implements scope management, type promotion, and ensures type safety across the entire program.

4. **Intermediate Representation (IR)** (`src/ir/`): Generates a Control Flow Graph (CFG) based IR with basic blocks, instructions, and SSA (Static Single Assignment) transformation.

5. **Assembly Generation** (`src/asm/`): Translates IR into x86 assembly code with support for multiple platforms and ABIs.

6. **Command Line Interface** (`src/cli.rs`): Built with `clap` for parsing command-line arguments, enforcing `.vn` file extension, and providing verbose output options.

### Key Features
- High-performance implementation in Rust
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Complete safety through Rust's memory and thread safety guarantees
- Support for multiple numeric types, arrays, functions, control flow structures

## Technology Stack

- **Primary Language**: Rust 2024 edition (requires Rust 1.85+)
- **Lexer**: Logos crate for efficient tokenization with regex-based pattern matching
- **CLI**: Clap for sophisticated command-line argument parsing with custom styling
- **Testing**: Built-in Rust testing framework with insta for snapshot testing
- **Benchmarking**: Criterion.rs for performance benchmarking
- **Error Handling**: Thiserror for ergonomic error type definitions
- **Dependencies**: 
  - clap (CLI parsing with derive macros)
  - console (terminal styling and formatting)
  - logos (lexer with high-performance tokenization)
  - thiserror (error handling with automatic implementation)
  - regex (regular expression support)
  - lazy_static (lazy initialization of static values)
  - uuid (universally unique identifier generation)
  - petgraph (graph data structures for IR representation)
  - insta (snapshot testing for output validation)
  - criterion (performance benchmarking and optimization validation)

## Language Features (.vn files)

The compiler supports a rich custom language with these features:

### Functions
- Typed parameters and return types with explicit type annotations
- Support for main function as program entry point
- Function declarations with `fun` keyword

### Variables and Constants
- Explicit typing with `var` (mutable) and `const` (immutable) declarations
- Type inference for initializers
- Support for multiple variable declarations in a single statement

### Numeric Types
- Signed integers: i8, i16, i32, i64
- Unsigned integers: u8, u16, u32, u64
- Floating-point: f32, f64
- Literal suffixes for explicit typing (e.g., 42u, 3.14f)
- Scientific notation support (e.g., 6.022e23)
- Base-specific literals: binary (#b1010), octal (#o755), hexadecimal (#xdeadbeef)

### Data Types
- Character literals ('A', '\n', '\u{1F600}')
- String literals ("Hello, World!")
- Boolean values (true, false)
- Null pointer literal (nullptr)

### Control Structures
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loop constructs (while, for)
- Break and continue statements for loop control
- Block scoping with curly braces

### Arrays and Collections
- Fixed-size arrays with explicit sizing (var arr: i64[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Array access with bracket notation

### Comments
- Single-line comments (// This is a comment)
- Multi-line comments (/* This is a multi-line comment */)

Example syntax:
```rust
fun add(num1: i8, num2: i8): i8 {
    return num1 + num2
}

main {
    var x: i64 = 1 + 4 - (12 + 3) / 3
    var y: i8 = 12i8
    var arr: i64[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    
    if (x >= 10) {
        var result: i8 = add(5i8, 3i8)
    } else {
        x = factorial(5)
    }
}
```

## Architecture

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes source code using Logos
2. **Parsing**: Builds AST from tokens using a recursive descent parser
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Type checking and symbol resolution
4. **IR Generation**: Creates multiple intermediate representations
5. **Code Generation**: (Planned) Assembly or other target code generation
