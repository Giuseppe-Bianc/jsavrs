## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Ensure you have Rust installed. You can install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Cargo**: Rust's package manager (installed with Rust).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Giuseppe-Bianc/jsavrs.git
   cd jsavrs
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To use `jsavrs`, you can run the compiled binary with the following command:

```bash
./jsavrs input_file.rs
```

This will compile the specified Rust file and output the result to the default location.

### Advanced Usage

You can customize the behavior of `jsavrs` using command-line flags:

- Specify an output directory:
  ```bash
  ./jsavrs input_file.rs --output ./build
  ```
- Enable verbose logging:
  ```bash
  ./jsavrs input_file.rs --verbose
  ```
- Compile multiple files:
  ```bash
  ./jsavrs file1.rs file2.rs file3.rs
  ```

For a full list of options, run:

```bash
./jsavrs --help
```

## Testing

`jsavrs` includes a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure reliability and correctness. To run the tests, use the
following command:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Adding New Tests

If you add new features or fix bugs, ensure you write corresponding tests. Tests are located in the `tests` directory
and follow Rust's standard testing conventions.

Example of a unit test:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_example() {
    assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
}
```
