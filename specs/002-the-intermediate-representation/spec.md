# Feature Specification: IR Type Promotion System Correction

**Feature Branch**: `002-the-intermediate-representation`  
**Created**: 29 settembre 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The intermediate representation (IR) currently exhibits incorrect or inconsistent type-promotion behavior when evaluating operations that involve operands of different types. This change request requires a systematic correction of the IR's type-promotion rules so that mixed-type operations are handled deterministically and according to a clearly specified promotion policy. The policy must define a type lattice (or ranking), a deterministic rule for selecting a common type (least upper bound), and explicit insertion of conversion (cast) nodes in the IR where promotion is required. The implementation should preserve numeric precision whenever possible, correctly handle signed/unsigned interactions, and include regression tests covering representative cases (e.g., int + float, int32 + int64, signed/unsigned mixes, and special floating-point cases such as NaN and infinities). Finally, update the documentation and the code-generation backend to reflect the corrected promotion semantics."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What should be the promotion rule for integer-float mixing (i32 + f32)? ‚Üí A: Floating-point types take precedence (i32 + f32 ‚Üí f32)
- Q: When mixing signed and unsigned integers of same width (i32 + u32), what should be the promotion behavior? ‚Üí A: Promote to next larger signed type (i32 + u32 ‚Üí i64)
- Q: When type conversion could result in data loss (e.g., f64 to i32), what should be the system's behavior? ‚Üí A: Insert runtime checks with configurable behavior
- Q: What should be the performance impact tolerance for the new type promotion system? ‚Üí A: Focus on correctness over performance initially
- Q: When corrected type promotion rules conflict with existing code expectations, what should be the compatibility approach? ‚Üí A: Gradual transition with warnings

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the jsavrs compiler, when I write expressions that involve operands of different types (such as mixing integers with floats, or different integer sizes), I expect the compiler's intermediate representation to handle type promotion in a consistent, deterministic, and mathematically sound manner that preserves precision whenever possible and follows clearly documented rules.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an expression with mixed integer and floating-point types, **When** the IR generator processes this expression, **Then** the promotion must follow a deterministic type lattice with floating-point types taking precedence while preserving precision
2. **Given** mixed integer operations of different sizes (e.g., int32 + int64), **When** the IR processes the operation, **Then** the result must promote to the wider integer type with appropriate signedness handling
3. **Given** signed and unsigned integer mixing, **When** type promotion occurs, **Then** the system must handle the interaction according to well-defined rules that prevent unexpected behavior
4. **Given** special floating-point values (NaN, infinity), **When** involved in mixed-type operations, **Then** the system must handle these cases correctly according to IEEE standards
5. **Given** any mixed-type operation requiring promotion, **When** the IR is generated, **Then** explicit cast nodes must be inserted where type conversion is required
6. **Given** updated promotion rules, **When** code generation occurs, **Then** the backend must correctly implement the new semantics

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle operations between the smallest and largest representable types?
- What happens when precision loss is unavoidable during type promotion?
- How are overflow and underflow conditions handled during promotion?
- What happens with user-defined types that have conversion operators?
- How does the system handle promotion in complex expressions with multiple operators?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST define a complete type lattice (ranking) that determines promotion precedence for all supported numeric types, with floating-point types taking precedence over integer types in mixed operations
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement deterministic rules for selecting a common type (least upper bound) for any pair of operand types
- **FR-003**: System MUST insert explicit conversion (cast) nodes in the IR wherever type promotion is required
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve numeric precision whenever mathematically possible during type promotion
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle signed/unsigned integer interactions by promoting to the next larger signed type when operands have the same width (e.g., i32 + u32 ‚Üí i64)
- **FR-006**: System MUST correctly process special floating-point cases (NaN, infinity, denormalized numbers) during mixed-type operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide comprehensive regression test coverage for representative mixed-type operation cases
- **FR-008**: System MUST update all documentation to reflect the corrected promotion semantics
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure the code-generation backend correctly implements the new promotion rules
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle complex expressions with multiple mixed-type operations consistently
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear error messages when type promotion cannot be performed safely
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement a gradual transition approach with compiler warnings when corrected type promotion rules conflict with existing code expectations
- **FR-013**: System MUST insert runtime checks for potential data loss during type conversion with configurable behavior (saturate, wrap, trap)
- **FR-014**: System MUST prioritize correctness over performance in the initial implementation, with performance optimization as a subsequent phase
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide clear compiler warnings during the transition period to help developers identify code that relies on the old incorrect promotion behavior

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Type Lattice**: A hierarchical ordering of all numeric types that defines promotion precedence and relationships between types
- **Promotion Policy**: The algorithmic rules and decision logic for determining the target type when multiple types are involved in an operation
- **Cast Nodes**: Explicit IR nodes that represent type conversion operations, inserted automatically when promotion requires actual data transformation
- **Mixed-Type Operations**: Binary and n-ary operations involving operands of different numeric types that require promotion resolution
- **Precision Rules**: Guidelines that govern when and how numeric precision should be preserved or managed during type promotion
- **Backend Integration**: The interface between the corrected IR type system and the code generation phases that produce target machine code
