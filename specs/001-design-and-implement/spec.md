**Feature Branch**: `001-design-and-implement`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Design and implement an x86-64 assembly-code generator to translate an explicitly specified intermediate representation (IR) into syntactically valid and semantically equivalent Netwide Assembler (NASM) source code. Focus on the following requirements to ensure the correct functionality and robustness of the assembly-code generator: 1. Semantics Preservation, 2. Calling-Convention Implementation, 3. Function Prologues and Epilogues, 4. OS Independence, 5. Compliance with Standards, 6. Diagnostics and Verification"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A compiler developer using the jsavrs compiler wants to compile their source code to x86-64 assembly. They input their program, which gets processed through the compiler pipeline, and receive syntactically correct NASM assembly code that preserves the original program semantics and can be assembled and linked on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid IR representation of a simple function, **When** the assembly generator processes it, **Then** it produces NASM-compatible x86-64 assembly with correct function prologue/epilogue
2. **Given** an IR with function calls, **When** the generator processes calling conventions, **Then** it correctly handles register preservation and stack alignment per platform ABI
3. **Given** IR code with various data types, **When** the generator translates them, **Then** the assembly maintains semantic equivalence with proper memory layout
4. **Given** complex control flow in IR, **When** the generator processes it, **Then** the assembly preserves branching logic and maintains execution semantics
5. **Given** the same IR input, **When** targeting different operating systems, **Then** the generator produces platform-appropriate assembly while maintaining semantic equivalence

### Edge Cases
- What happens when IR contains unsupported or invalid constructs?
- How does the system handle extremely deep function call stacks?
- What occurs when register allocation conflicts arise during translation?
- How does the generator manage large data structures that exceed register capacity?
- What happens when platform-specific calling convention requirements conflict?
