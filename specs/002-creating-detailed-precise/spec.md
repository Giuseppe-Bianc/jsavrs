# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Test Suite for Type Promotion Module

**Feature Branch**: `002-creating-detailed-precise`  
**Created**: domenica 5 ottobre 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "You are tasked with creating detailed, precise, thorough, and in-depth test cases for the `src/ir/type_promotion.rs` file. 1. **Objective:** Develop a comprehensive test suite covering normal, edge, and corner cases. 2. **Test Plan:** - Study the specified code to understand their logic and purpose. - Identify all potential execution pathways, including edge and corner cases. - Document test descriptions specifying what's tested, expected outcomes, and reasoning. 3. **Implementation:** - Write the tests within the existing file: `tests/ir_type_promotion_tests.rs`. - Add each test case to the end of the file, accommodating for seamless integration. 4. **Execution:** Ensure each test is executable in the current testing framework, verifying that your newly introduced tests are functional without disrupting existing tests. Follow through this plan and structure the tests accordingly to ensure comprehensive coverage."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What is the minimum code coverage target for the type promotion module? ‚Üí A: 100% coverage (every line must be tested)
- Q: How should tests behave when encountering conditions that cause panics in the type promotion code? ‚Üí A: Tests must verify both expected panics and graceful error handling
- Q: Should performance benchmarks be included for type promotion operations? ‚Üí A: No, only functional tests (no benchmarks)
- Q: What level of granularity should tests have for helper/utility functions in the module? ‚Üí A: Mix: direct tests for complex helpers, indirect for simple ones
- Q: What level of inline documentation should test cases have? ‚Üí A: Only test case description (function name + doc comment)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the jsavrs compiler, I want a comprehensive test suite for the type promotion module so that I can confidently make changes to the code without introducing regressions or unexpected behavior in type conversion operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a type promotion module with incomplete test coverage, **When** the comprehensive test suite is added, **Then** all functions in the `src/ir/type_promotion.rs` file will have 100% line coverage including normal, edge, and corner cases.
2. **Given** an existing test suite with basic functionality tests, **When** the enhanced test suite is integrated, **Then** the code coverage for the type promotion module will reach 100% and all edge cases will be properly validated.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when type promotion encounters invalid or unsupported type combinations? [Tests must verify both panic behavior with `#[should_panic]` and graceful error handling with Result types]
- How does the system handle type promotion with extremely large or small numeric values? [Tests must validate boundary conditions and potential overflow scenarios]
- What occurs when the type promotion algorithm encounters circular type dependencies? [Tests must verify detection and appropriate error responses]
- How does the system behave when memory constraints prevent the creation of intermediate types? [Tests must validate resource exhaustion scenarios]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST include comprehensive unit tests achieving 100% line coverage for all public functions in `src/ir/type_promotion.rs`
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute all new tests without disrupting existing functionality in the test suite
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to run the comprehensive test suite using standard Rust testing commands like `cargo test`
- **FR-004**: System MUST include both normal operation test cases and edge case scenarios for type promotion operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear test descriptions specifying what is being tested, expected outcomes, and reasoning
- **FR-006**: System MUST verify 100% code coverage through automated coverage tools (e.g., `cargo llvm-cov`)
- **FR-007**: System MUST test both expected panic conditions using `#[should_panic]` attribute and graceful error handling using Result/Error patterns
- **FR-008**: System MUST focus exclusively on functional correctness testing without performance benchmarks
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide direct unit tests for complex helper functions while testing simple helper functions indirectly through public API integration tests
- **FR-010**: System MUST document each test with a descriptive function name and doc comment explaining what is tested, expected outcome, and reasoning, without inline comments for individual assertions

### Key Entities
- **Type Promotion Module**: The Rust code in `src/ir/type_promotion.rs` that handles conversion between different data types during compilation
- **Test Suite File**: The test file `tests/ir_type_promotion_tests.rs` where new tests will be added to provide comprehensive coverage
- **Type Conversion Operations**: The specific operations that convert values from one type to another according to language rules
