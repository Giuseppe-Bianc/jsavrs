# Specification Quality Checklist: x86-64 NASM Assembly Code Generator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-17

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ Specification is written in terms of what the generator must do, not how it's implemented
- ✅ Focus is on compiler developer needs and correct assembly generation
- ✅ Technical concepts are explained at the appropriate abstraction level
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ No clarification markers present - all requirements are concrete
- ✅ Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-040) is specific and testable
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with concrete metrics (assembly correctness, NASM validation, execution time, error detection)
- ✅ Success criteria focus on observable outcomes rather than implementation
- ✅ Nine user stories with prioritized acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Fifteen edge cases identified covering phi functions, register pressure, platform differences, etc.
- ✅ Clear scope boundaries in "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ Comprehensive assumptions (20 items) and dependencies (17 items) documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ User stories are independently testable and prioritized (P1-P9)
- ✅ Primary flows covered: basic translation (P1), control flow (P2), function calls (P3), memory ops (P4)
- ✅ Each user story includes clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ 15 measurable success criteria defined
- ✅ Specification maintains abstraction - no Rust code, no specific data structures mentioned

### Overall Assessment
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase. All quality criteria are met:
- Requirements are unambiguous and testable
- User scenarios are prioritized and independently implementable
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Scope, assumptions, and dependencies are well-defined
- No clarifications needed - the feature is well-understood

## Recommendations for Planning Phase

When proceeding to `/speckit.plan`:
1. **Start with P1 (Basic Function Translation)** - this provides the foundation for all other features
2. **Consider register allocation early** - it's a cross-cutting concern affecting multiple user stories
3. **Platform-specific code** can be abstracted behind the ABI interface (already exists in codebase)
4. **Error collection mechanism** should be designed upfront to support all translation phases
5. **Testing strategy** should include both unit tests (individual IR constructs) and integration tests (complete functions assembled and executed)
