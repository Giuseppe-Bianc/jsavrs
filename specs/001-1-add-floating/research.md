# Research: IEEE 754 Floating-Point Support Implementation

## Decision: IEEE 754 Standard Implementation Approach
**Rationale**: The implementation will leverage Rust enums for type-safe floating-point registers and instructions to prevent invalid combinations at compile-time, ensuring compliance with IEEE 754-2008 standards. This approach follows the project's Documentation Rigor constitutional principle by creating comprehensive documentation for all new components.

## Architecture Decision: Enum-Based Type System
**Rationale**: Using Rust enums for floating-point registers (XMM0-XMM15, YMM0-YMM15, ZMM0-ZMM15) and instructions prevents invalid register-instruction combinations at compile time, reducing runtime validation errors. This aligns with the Safety First constitutional principle by catching potential errors during compilation rather than at runtime.

## Technology Stack Research

### Rust 1.75+ with IEEE 754 Compliance Libraries
- **Decision**: Use Rust's type system with custom enums for floating-point registers and operations
- **Rationale**: Provides compile-time safety and prevents invalid register-instruction combinations
- **Alternatives considered**: String-based identifiers (rejected due to runtime errors) and integer-based enums (rejected due to lack of type safety)

### x86-64 SSE/AVX Instruction Sets
- **Decision**: Implement support for XMM, YMM, and ZMM registers following x86-64 architecture
- **Rationale**: These are the standard SIMD registers for floating-point operations on x86-64 platforms
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom register implementations (rejected for not leveraging existing architecture)

### IEEE 754-2008 Specification Compliance
- **Decision**: Implement full compliance with IEEE 754-2008 for binary32 and binary64 formats
- **Rationale**: Ensures compatibility with existing software ecosystems and mathematical standards
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom floating-point format (rejected for lack of compatibility)

## ABI Compliance Research

### Windows x64 ABI and System V ABI Support
- **Decision**: Implement configurable ABI support based on target platform
- **Rationale**: Ensures cross-platform compatibility as required by Cross-Platform Compatibility constitutional principle
- **How**: Compile-time configuration with different code paths for parameter passing and register usage

## Exception Handling Framework

### IEEE 754 Exception Types Implementation
- **Decision**: Implement all five IEEE 754 exception types (Invalid Operation, Division by Zero, Overflow, Underflow, Inexact) with configurable behavior modes
- **Rationale**: Full compliance with the IEEE 754 standard and configurable behavior for different use cases
- **Alternatives considered**: Simplified exception handling (rejected for not meeting compliance requirements)

## MXCSR Register Management

### Floating-Point Control State Implementation
- **Decision**: Create abstractions for reading, writing, and managing the x86-64 MXCSR register including all four IEEE 754 rounding modes
- **Rationale**: Essential for proper floating-point state management and ABI compliance
- **How**: Abstract API that handles MXCSR register operations while respecting ABI conventions

## Subnormal Number Handling

### FTZ and DAZ Mode Implementation
- **Decision**: Implement optional Flush-To-Zero and Denormals-Are-Zero modes configurable via MXCSR
- **Rationale**: Performance optimization for applications that don't require full subnormal precision
- **Alternatives considered**: Always use full subnormal support (rejected for performance reasons in some use cases)

## Testing Strategy

### Bit-Exact IEEE 754 Compliance Verification
- **Decision**: Implement custom floating-point validation harness with comprehensive test vectors
- **Rationale**: Ensures 100% compliance with IEEE 754 standards
- **How**: Use existing cargo test framework with Insta snapshot testing for output validation
