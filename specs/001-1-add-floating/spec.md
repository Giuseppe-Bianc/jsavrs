**Feature Branch**: `001-1-add-floating`  
**Created**: gioved√¨ 25 settembre 2025

Enhance the operand handling to support floating-point values 4. Update the instruction formatting in the Display implementation 5. Add support for different floating-point formats (32-bit float, 64-bit double, etc.) 6. Add instructions for proper IEEE 754 exception handling and rounding control"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the jsavrs compiler, I want to write code that performs floating-point calculations, so that I can create applications that handle real numbers, scientific calculations, financial operations, and other scenarios that require decimal precision.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a program with floating-point variables and operations, **When** I compile the program with jsavrs, **Then** the compiler generates correct assembly code that uses appropriate floating-point registers and instructions following IEEE 754 standards.
2. **Given** a function with floating-point arithmetic operations, **When** I compile and execute the code, **Then** the floating-point computations follow IEEE 754 standards including proper handling of special values like infinity and NaN.
3. **Given** floating-point operations that may cause exceptions (overflow, underflow, division by zero), **When** the code executes, **Then** the compiler has generated appropriate instructions to handle these cases according to IEEE 754 standards.

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle floating-point operations that cause exceptions like overflow, underflow, invalid operation, division by zero, or inexact results? (Behavior configurable at compile-time between hardware exceptions and standard IEEE 754 special values)
- How does the compiler handle different floating-point precision formats (32-bit vs 64-bit) in the same program?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support IEEE 754 compliant floating-point operations in source code compilation
- **FR-002**: System MUST include floating-point registers (XMM0-XMM15, YMM0-YMM15, ZMM0-ZMM15) in the Register enum
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement IEEE 754 compliant floating-point instructions in the Instruction enum
- **FR-004**: System MUST enhance operand handling to support floating-point values
- **FR-005**: System MUST update instruction formatting in the Display implementation to properly format floating-point instructions
- **FR-006**: System MUST support both single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit) floating-point formats with equal priority
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement instructions for proper IEEE 754 exception handling with both behaviors (hardware exceptions and standard IEEE 754 special values) configurable at compile-time, plus all four standard rounding modes (to-nearest, toward-positive-infinity, toward-negative-infinity, toward-zero)
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate assembly code that correctly uses floating-point registers for floating-point operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST support standard floating-point operations including add, subtract, multiply, divide, compare, and conversion operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle IEEE 754 special values like NaN, infinity, and signed zero correctly
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide access to floating-point control registers for rounding modes and exception handling
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure generated floating-point code follows x86-64 calling conventions for floating-point parameters and return values, configurable depending on target platform (Windows x64 ABI for Windows, System V ABI for Unix/Linux)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Floating-Point Register**: An x86-64 register used to store floating-point values, supporting IEEE 754 standard formats including single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit) values
- **Floating-Point Operand**: A data operand that represents a floating-point value, either as an immediate value, register, or memory location containing IEEE 754 formatted data
- **Floating-Point Instruction**: An assembly instruction that operates on floating-point data, conforming to IEEE 754 standards for arithmetic, comparison, and conversion operations
- **IEEE 754 Format**: The standard representation for floating-point numbers including single-precision (binary32) and double-precision (binary64) formats, special values (NaN, infinity), and the four standard rounding modes (to-nearest, toward-positive-infinity, toward-negative-infinity, toward-zero)
