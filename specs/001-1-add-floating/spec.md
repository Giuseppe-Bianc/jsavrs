## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the jsavrs compiler, I want to write code that performs floating-point calculations, so that I can create applications that handle real numbers, scientific calculations, financial operations, and other scenarios that require decimal precision.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a program with floating-point variables and operations, **When** I compile the program with jsavrs, **Then** the compiler generates correct assembly code that uses appropriate floating-point registers and instructions following IEEE 754 standards.
2. **Given** a function with floating-point arithmetic operations, **When** I compile and execute the code, **Then** the floating-point computations follow IEEE 754 standards including proper handling of special values like infinity and NaN.
3. **Given** floating-point operations that may cause exceptions (overflow, underflow, division by zero), **When** the code executes, **Then** the compiler has generated appropriate instructions to handle these cases according to IEEE 754 standards.

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle floating-point operations that cause exceptions like overflow, underflow, invalid operation, division by zero, or inexact results? (Behavior configurable at compile-time between hardware exceptions and standard IEEE 754 special values)
- How does the compiler handle different floating-point precision formats (32-bit vs 64-bit) in the same program?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support IEEE 754 compliant floating-point operations in source code compilation
- **FR-002**: System MUST include floating-point registers (XMM0-XMM15, YMM0-YMM15, ZMM0-ZMM15) in the Register enum
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement IEEE 754 compliant floating-point instructions in the Instruction enum
- **FR-004**: System MUST enhance operand handling to support floating-point values
- **FR-005**: System MUST update instruction formatting in the Display implementation to properly format floating-point instructions
- **FR-006**: System MUST support both single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit) floating-point formats with equal priority
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement instructions for proper IEEE 754 exception handling with both behaviors (hardware exceptions and standard IEEE 754 special values) configurable at compile-time, plus all four standard rounding modes (to-nearest, toward-positive-infinity, toward-negative-infinity, toward-zero)
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate assembly code that correctly uses floating-point registers for floating-point operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST support standard floating-point operations including add, subtract, multiply, divide, compare, and conversion operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle IEEE 754 special values like NaN, infinity, and signed zero correctly
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide access to floating-point control registers for rounding modes and exception handling
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure generated floating-point code follows x86-64 calling conventions for floating-point parameters and return values, configurable depending on target platform (Windows x64 ABI for Windows, System V ABI for Unix/Linux)
- **FR-13**: System MUST support the full set of basic IEEE 754 arithmetic operations, including add, subtract, multiply, divide, and square root for both single and double precision formats.
- **FR-014**: System MUST support IEEE 754 conversion operations between floating-point and integer types (both signed and unsigned) for 32-bit and 64-bit integers, with defined behavior for out-of-range values (e.g., saturation or undefined)
- **FR-015**: System MUST correctly handle and generate code for IEEE 754 subnormal (denormal) numbers, ensuring computations with them are performed according to the standard, and MUST provide a compile-time option to enable Flush-To-Zero (FTZ) and Denormals-Are-Zero (DAZ) modes via the MXCSR register for performance-critical code 
- **FR-016**: System MUST implement all IEEE 754 comparison predicates, correctly handling the "unordered" result that occurs when at least one operand is NaN. Comparisons MUST not raise an exception when a NaN is an operand
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide a mechanism for the compiled program to read and write the floating-point status and control registers (specifically the MXCSR register for SSE/AVX instructions). This includes the ability to clear, set, and test the five standard exception flags: Invalid Operation, Division by Zero, Overflow, Underflow, and Inexact
- **FR-018**: System MUST ensure that the floating-point control state (e.g., rounding mode, exception masks in MXCSR) is managed according to the target platform's ABI. Specifically, the control bits of the MXCSR register are callee-saved and must be preserved across function calls, while the status bits are caller-saved
- **FR-019**: System MUST support fused multiply-add (FMA) operations if the target CPU architecture supports them, as they are a recommended operation in the IEEE 754 standard and provide higher precision for common computational patterns
- **FR-020**: System MUST correctly handle signed zero (+0 and -0) in all operations and comparisons, ensuring that +0 == -0 evaluates to true, but that operations like 1 / +0 and 1 / -0 yield +Infinity and -Infinity respectively, as per the IEEE 754 standard


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Floating-Point Register**: An x86-64 register used to store floating-point values, supporting IEEE 754 standard formats including single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit) values
- **Floating-Point Operand**: A data operand that represents a floating-point value, either as an immediate value, register, or memory location containing IEEE 754 formatted data
- **Floating-Point Instruction**: An assembly instruction that operates on floating-point data, conforming to IEEE 754 standards for arithmetic, comparison, and conversion operations
- **IEEE 754 Format**: The standard representation for floating-point numbers including single-precision (binary32) and double-precision (binary64) formats, special values (NaN, infinity), and the four standard rounding modes (to-nearest, toward-positive-infinity, toward-negative-infinity, toward-zero)
