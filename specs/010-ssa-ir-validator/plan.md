# Implementation Plan: SSA-based IR Validator with CFG

**Branch**: `010-ssa-ir-validator` | **Date**: 25-10-2025 | **Spec**: [Feature Specification](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/010-ssa-ir-validator/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a comprehensive validator for Static Single Assignment (SSA)-based Intermediate Representation (IR) with Control Flow Graph (CFG) validation. The validator ensures structural invariants (variable defined before use, proper loop structure, reachability), semantic invariants (type consistency, valid operands), and CFG integrity (proper node construction, entry/exit accessibility). The implementation includes detailed error reporting with location information and suggested fixes, along with automatic correction capabilities for common issues. Built upon the existing IR architecture in `src/ir/` with validation modules for each type of check.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75  
**Primary Dependencies**: Internal IR module in src/ir, thiserror for error handling, insta for snapshot testing  
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory validation with text/binary file input support)  
**Testing**: cargo test for unit/integration tests, insta for snapshot validation  
**Target Platform**: Linux, Windows, macOS (cross-platform compatibility per constitution)  
**Project Type**: Single binary/library (compiler component)  
**Performance Goals**: Process up to 10,000 lines of IR code within 5 minutes, minimize false positives to 5% or less  
**Constraints**: Must integrate seamlessly with existing IR architecture in src/ir, maintain 95% precision in validation  
**Scale/Scope**: Handles all structural, semantic, and CFG integrity validation requirements for SSA-based IR

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All implementations must follow the Core Principles of Safety First, Performance Excellence, Cross-Platform Compatibility, Modular Extensibility, Test-Driven Reliability, Snapshot Validation, and Documentation Rigor. Additionally, all community interactions must follow the Core Principles of Collaboration First, Respectful Communication, Shared Learning, Quality Through Community, and Transparency and Openness.

**Validation**: ✅ All validation requirements align with project principles:
- **Safety First**: Implementation uses memory-safe Rust with proper ownership patterns
- **Performance Excellence**: Validator meets 5-minute processing target for 10,000 lines
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Implementation supports Linux, Windows, macOS as required
- **Modular Extensibility**: Validation components are designed as separate modules for easy extension
- **Test-Driven Reliability**: Implementation includes comprehensive testing with cargo test and insta
- **Snapshot Validation**: Error output will be validated using insta snapshot testing
- **Documentation Rigor**: Complete documentation including research.md, data-model.md, and quickstart.md

**Structure Decision**: The validator will be implemented as a comprehensive module within the existing IR module with separate files for each validation type (structural, semantic, CFG integrity) and diagnostics. This modular approach ensures maintainability and separation of concerns while integrating seamlessly with the existing IR architecture. The CLI interface in `src/cli/mod.rs` and `src/main.rs` will support the command-line usage pattern described in the spec with standard options (-i for input, -o for output, -v for verbose, -c for config).

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |

| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
