# Feature Specification: SSA-based IR Validator with CFG

**Feature Branch**: `010-ssa-ir-validator`  
**Created**: 25-10-2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Design a detailed validator for a Static Single Assignment (SSA)-based Intermediate Representation (IR) with Control Flow Graph (CFG). The validator must ensure the following: - **Structural Invariants**: Check that each variable is defined before use, loops have appropriate entry and exit points, and all control flow paths are reachable. - **Semantic Invariants**: Verify type consistency, ensure values have compatible types, and that operations are executed with valid operands. - **CFG Integrity**: Validate the proper construction of the CFG, including the existence and accessibility of entry and exit nodes. For the diagnostics: - Generate detailed error reports that identify specific line numbers and constructs within the IR or CFG where errors occur. - Include suggestions for potential corrections or refactorings for each error identified. For automated fixes: - Where feasible, automate common corrections, such as renaming variables to avoid conflicts or adjusting control flow to ensure reachability. - Provide a log of all automated fixes performed, ensuring transparency in modifications. Aim for precision and meticulousness in every aspect of validation to minimize false positives and negatives in the analysis."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Validate SSA IR Structure (Priority: P1)

Compiler developers need to verify that their Static Single Assignment (SSA)-based Intermediate Representation (IR) meets structural requirements. They run the validator on their IR code to check that each variable is defined before use, loops have appropriate entry and exit points, and all control flow paths are reachable.

**Why this priority**: This is the core validation functionality that ensures the basic structure of the IR is correct before any optimization or compilation occurs, preventing downstream issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the validator on IR code with various structural violations and confirming all structural errors are correctly identified and reported.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** IR code with a variable used before it's defined, **When** validator is executed, **Then** an error is reported at the specific location with a suggestion to verify variable definition order
2. **Given** properly structured IR code that meets all structural requirements, **When** validator is executed, **Then** no structural errors are reported

### User Story 2 - Validate Semantic Invariants and Type Consistency (Priority: P2)

Compiler developers need to ensure type safety in their IR code. They run the validator to check that operations are executed with valid operands and that values have compatible types throughout the program.

**Why this priority**: Type safety is critical for preventing runtime errors and ensuring the compiled code behaves as expected.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the validator on IR code with various type inconsistencies and confirming all semantic errors are correctly identified and reported.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** IR code with an operation between incompatible types, **When** validator is executed, **Then** an error is reported with details about the type mismatch and suggestions for correction
2. **Given** IR code with properly typed operations, **When** validator is executed, **Then** no semantic errors are reported

---

### User Story 3 - Validate Control Flow Graph (CFG) Integrity (Priority: P3)

Compiler developers need to ensure the Control Flow Graph of their IR is properly constructed. They run the validator to verify the existence and accessibility of entry and exit nodes.

**Why this priority**: A properly constructed CFG is essential for optimization and code generation phases in the compiler pipeline.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the validator on IR code with various CFG issues and confirming all integrity errors are correctly identified and reported.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** IR code with an unreachable block in the CFG, **When** validator is executed, **Then** an error is reported about the unreachable code with suggestions for making it accessible
2. **Given** IR code with properly connected CFG nodes, **When** validator is executed, **Then** no CFG integrity errors are reported

---

### User Story 4 - Generate Detailed Error Reports and Corrections (Priority: P4)

Compiler developers need detailed diagnostics to understand and fix IR validation errors. The validator should generate detailed error reports with line numbers and provide suggestions for corrections.

**Why this priority**: Good error reporting and correction suggestions improve developer productivity and reduce debugging time.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the validator on IR code with various errors and verifying that detailed reports with accurate line numbers and helpful suggestions are generated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** IR code with validation errors, **When** validator is executed, **Then** detailed error reports are generated with specific line numbers and suggested corrections
2. **Given** IR code with validation errors that can be automatically fixed, **When** validator is executed in auto-fix mode, **Then** corrections are applied and a log of performed fixes is generated
