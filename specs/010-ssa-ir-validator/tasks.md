# Implementation Tasks: SSA-based IR Validator with CFG

## Feature Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive validator for Static Single Assignment (SSA)-based Intermediate Representation (IR) with Control Flow Graph (CFG) validation. The validator ensures structural invariants (variable defined before use, proper loop structure, reachability), semantic invariants (type consistency, valid operands), and CFG integrity (proper node construction, entry/exit accessibility). The implementation includes detailed error reporting with location information and suggested fixes, along with automatic correction capabilities for common issues.

**Branch**: `010-ssa-ir-validator`  
**Target Language**: Rust 1.75+  
**Dependencies**: Internal IR module in src/ir, thiserror for error handling, insta for snapshot testing

## Dependencies
- User Story 2 (Semantic validation) depends on foundational data models
- User Story 3 (CFG validation) depends on foundational data models
- User Story 4 (Diagnostics and fixes) depends on all other validation components

## Parallel Execution Examples
- T005-T010 (Structural validation components) can run in parallel with T011-T015 (Semantic validation components)
- T016-T020 (CFG validation components) can run after foundational components are complete
- T021-T025 (Diagnostics and fixes) run after all validation components are implemented

## Implementation Strategy
- **MVP Scope**: Focus on User Story 1 (Structural validation) in initial implementation
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each user story builds on the previous one, with foundational components developed first
- **Test Integration**: Each validation component will have corresponding tests to ensure proper functionality

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Validate SSA IR Structure (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Implement structural validation to check that each variable is defined before use, loops have appropriate entry and exit points, and all control flow paths are reachable.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Validate Semantic Invariants and Type Consistency (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement semantic validation to check that operations are executed with valid operands and that values have compatible types throughout the program.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Validator correctly identifies type mismatches and invalid operands in IR code.

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Validate Control Flow Graph (CFG) Integrity (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Implement CFG validation to verify the existence and accessibility of entry and exit nodes and ensure proper graph construction.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Validator correctly identifies CFG integrity issues including missing nodes and invalid edges.
