# Research Findings: Add Comprehensive Tests for Assembly Module

## Decision: Technology Stack Selection
**Rationale**: Selected Rust's native testing framework with supporting tools based on project requirements for 100% coverage and cross-platform compatibility. The jsavrs project already uses Rust, so leveraging the existing ecosystem ensures consistency and maintainability.

## Technology Choices:

### 1. Core Testing Framework
- **Decision**: Use Rust's built-in `#[cfg(test)]` and `cargo test` for unit and integration tests
- **Rationale**: Integrated with the Rust toolchain, widely supported, and meets project's needs for comprehensive testing
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - Custom test framework: Would add complexity and maintenance overhead
  - External frameworks like Speculo (property-based testing): Would add dependencies without significant benefit

### 2. Snapshot Testing
- **Decision**: Use `insta` crate for snapshot testing
- **Rationale**: Essential for validating assembly output consistency across different target operating systems as specified in the clarifications
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Manual string comparisons: Would require constant updates when legitimate changes occur
  - Custom snapshot solution: Would duplicate existing functionality and add maintenance burden

### 3. Code Coverage
- **Decision**: Use `cargo-llvm-cov` for measuring 100% statement coverage
- **Rationale**: Specifically designed for Rust projects and capable of measuring statement coverage as required by the functional requirements. Provides detailed reports and integrates well with the Rust toolchain.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - `tarpaulin`: Alternative coverage tool but may have compatibility issues with certain code patterns
  - `kcov`: External tool with potential compatibility issues

### 4. Cross-Platform Testing
- **Decision**: Use mocking for OS-specific functionality combined with conditional compilation
- **Rationale**: Allows testing of OS-specific code paths without needing to execute on each platform, as specified in the clarifications
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Actual execution on each OS: Would require extensive CI setup and infrastructure
  - No mocking: Would make cross-platform testing impractical

## Research on Assembly Module Components

### Key Areas to Test
Based on the functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-025), the following components need comprehensive testing:

1. **Register module**: All register sizes (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit) with boundary conditions
2. **Operand module**: Registers, immediates, labels, memory references with complex addressing modes
3. **Instruction module**: All instruction types and operand combinations with edge cases
4. **NASM Generator**: Section handling, label generation, hello world generation, function prologue/epilogue
5. **TargetOS module**: Parameter registers, callee-saved registers for different operating systems
6. **Utility functions**: Conversion functions, type checking, formatting methods

## Performance Considerations

The requirement for test suite execution under 1 minute necessitates:
- Parallel test execution where possible
- Efficient test design avoiding unnecessary computation
- Separation of unit tests (fast) from integration tests (potentially slower)

## Test Organization Strategy

Following requirement FR-016, tests will be organized in separate files per module component:
- `registers_test.rs` - Tests for register implementations
- `operands_test.rs` - Tests for operand implementations  
- `instructions_test.rs` - Tests for instruction implementations
- `nasm_generator_test.rs` - Tests for NASM generator functionality
- `target_os_test.rs` - Tests for target OS implementations
- `hello_world_generation_test.rs` - Tests for cross-platform hello world generation
- `factorial_function_test.rs` - Tests for factorial function generation

## Edge Case Coverage

Based on the specification, tests will include:
- Boundary values: i64::MIN, i64::MAX, 0, Â±1 for immediate operands
- Invalid inputs: Invalid register combinations, out-of-range displacements
- Complex addressing modes: Including RIP-relative addressing
- All supported calling conventions for different target operating systems
- Error conditions and invalid parameter handling
