## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the jsavrs compiler, I want comprehensive tests for the assembly generation module so that I can ensure the correctness of the generated x86-64 assembly code for different target operating systems and architectures.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the assembly module with its register, operand, instruction, and generator components, **When** tests are run, **Then** all components are thoroughly validated with edge cases and corner cases covered
2. **Given** a developer making changes to the assembly generation code, **When** they run the test suite, **Then** any regressions or incorrect behavior are caught by the comprehensive test coverage
3. **Given** the existing test suite for the assembly module, **When** new functionality is added, **Then** there are clear examples and patterns for adding similarly detailed tests for the new features

### Edge Cases
- What happens when generating code for different target operating systems (Linux, Windows, MacOS)?
- How does the system handle invalid register combinations or operand types?
- What happens when generating large or complex assembly programs?
- How does the system handle memory reference edge cases like complex addressing modes?
- How does the system behave with boundary values for immediate operands?
- What happens when generating code that uses all available registers?
