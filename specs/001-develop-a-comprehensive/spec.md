## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: Should the ABI trait system support mixed-mode calling conventions (64-bit code interfacing with 32-bit libraries/syscalls)? ‚Üí A: No - Pure 64-bit only, out of scope for this feature
- Q: Should the ABI trait design accommodate future ABI specification revisions or platform-specific extensions through versioning? ‚Üí A: No - Implement current stable ABIs only, extensible design without explicit versioning
- Q: What is the maximum structure size (in bytes) for pass-by-value semantics before requiring pass-by-reference or hidden pointer? ‚Üí A: Match compiler reference: GCC/Clang/MSVC behavior
- Q: For variadic functions (e.g., printf-style), how should floating-point arguments be classified on System V ABI? ‚Üí A: Platform-dependent: match reference ABI specification exactly
- Q: When the ABI trait is queried with invalid or unsupported parameters (e.g., invalid register for platform), what should the behavior be? ‚Üí A: Type system prevents invalid queries (compile-time safety)
- Q: What is the acceptable performance target for ABI specification queries? ‚Üí A: Negligible (< 0.1% of total compilation time) - essentially free lookups via constant tables
- Q: How should SIMD vector type parameters (XMM/YMM/ZMM) be handled when they exceed available registers? ‚Üí A: Match reference compiler behavior - defer to GCC/Clang/MSVC conventions
- Q: What alignment and padding rules apply for nested structures containing other structures or arrays? ‚Üí A: Match reference compiler layout - defer to GCC/Clang/MSVC structure packing
- Q: What level of detail is required for red zone specification (System V 128-byte vs Windows prohibition)? ‚Üí A: Query interface - provide methods to check red zone availability and size
- Q: What level of diagnostic/observability support is needed for the ABI trait system? ‚Üí A: Comprehensive logging - trace ABI decisions for compiler debugging

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a compiler engineer developing the jsavrs compiler, I need a standardized interface that provides authoritative Application Binary Interface specifications for x86-64 assembly generation across multiple operating system platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS). This interface must accurately represent the platform-specific calling conventions, register usage rules, stack alignment requirements, and parameter passing mechanisms to ensure that generated assembly code correctly interfaces with system libraries and maintains cross-platform compatibility.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a compiler backend targeting Windows x86-64 platform with a function requiring integer parameters, **When** the ABI specification is queried for parameter passing conventions, **Then** the system must provide accurate register allocation rules specifying that the first four integer/pointer parameters utilize RCX, RDX, R8, R9 registers respectively, with subsequent parameters passed via stack.

2. **Given** a compiler backend targeting System V ABI (Linux/macOS) with a function requiring floating-point parameters, **When** the ABI specification is queried for parameter passing conventions, **Then** the system must provide accurate register allocation rules specifying that up to eight floating-point parameters utilize XMM0-XMM7 registers, with correct ordering and size handling.

3. **Given** a compiler backend generating a function prologue, **When** the ABI specification is queried for stack alignment requirements, **Then** the system must provide platform-specific alignment constraints (16-byte alignment for System V, specific requirements for Windows) and shadow space allocation rules.

4. **Given** a compiler backend requiring register preservation during function calls, **When** the ABI specification is queried for volatile and non-volatile register classifications, **Then** the system must accurately identify which registers must be preserved by the callee versus which may be freely modified.

5. **Given** a compiler backend generating assembly code for structure or union parameters, **When** the ABI specification is queried for aggregate type handling, **Then** the system must provide rules for when aggregates are passed by value, by reference, or decomposed into registers based on size and composition.

6. **Given** a compiler backend requiring return value handling, **When** the ABI specification is queried for return value conventions, **Then** the system must specify correct register usage for scalar returns (RAX for integers, XMM0 for floating-point) and memory-based returns for large structures.

7. **Given** a compiler backend targeting a specific operating system, **When** the ABI specification is queried for platform identification, **Then** the system must correctly distinguish between Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms and provide corresponding ABI variant selection.

### Edge Cases

- **Variadic Functions**: The system SHALL handle ABI specifications for functions with variable argument lists following platform-specific conventions exactly as defined in reference ABI documentation. This includes SystemV's AL register convention for tracking floating-point argument count in XMM registers and Windows x64's uniform register/stack handling.

- **Large Structure Returns**: Structure return mechanisms SHALL follow reference compiler conventions (GCC, Clang, MSVC). Structures exceeding platform-specific size thresholds require hidden pointer parameters with caller-allocated memory management.

- **Vector Type Parameters**: SIMD vector types (XMM 128-bit, YMM 256-bit, ZMM 512-bit) SHALL be handled according to reference compiler conventions (GCC, Clang, MSVC) for the target platform. This includes register allocation, stack-passing with natural alignment, and overflow handling when available vector registers are exhausted.

- **Nested Structure Alignment**: Nested structures (structures containing other structures or arrays) SHALL follow reference compiler layout conventions (GCC, Clang, MSVC) for the target platform. This includes alignment rules, internal padding, and total structure size calculations affecting both stack layout and parameter passing mechanisms.

- **Red Zone Usage**: The system SHALL provide a query interface to determine red zone availability and size for each platform. SystemV ABI provides a 128-byte red zone below RSP available for leaf functions without stack adjustment, while Windows x64 prohibits red zone usage entirely. The interface must enable compiler optimizations to leverage red zone when available.

- **Mixed-Mode Calling**: Mixed-mode calling conventions (64-bit/32-bit interoperability) are explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this feature. The system focuses exclusively on pure 64-bit ABI specifications.

- **ABI Version Evolution**: The system SHALL focus on current stable ABI specifications (Windows x64, SystemV) without explicit version tracking. The design MUST be extensible to accommodate future platform-specific extensions through modular architecture rather than versioning mechanisms.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide accurate calling convention specifications for Windows x64 ABI, including precise register allocation rules for the first four parameters (RCX, RDX, R8, R9) and stack parameter placement for subsequent arguments.

- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide accurate calling convention specifications for SystemV ABI (used by Linux and macOS), including register allocation rules for up to six integer/pointer parameters (RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9) and eight floating-point parameters (XMM0-XMM7).

- **FR-003**: The system MUST specify correct volatile (caller-saved) and non-volatile (callee-saved) register classifications for each supported platform, enabling proper register preservation code generation.

- **FR-004**: The system MUST define stack alignment requirements for each platform, including 16-byte alignment boundaries and shadow space allocation rules (32 bytes for Windows x64).

- **FR-005**: The system MUST specify return value conventions, including register usage for scalar types (RAX for integers and pointers, XMM0 for floating-point) and memory-based return mechanisms for aggregate types.

- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide rules for structure and union parameter passing, including size thresholds determining pass-by-value versus pass-by-reference semantics and register decomposition criteria. Structure size thresholds SHALL match reference compiler behavior (GCC, Clang, MSVC) for the target platform.

- **FR-007**: The system MUST distinguish between platform-specific ABI variants (Windows, Linux, macOS) and enable selection of appropriate conventions based on target platform identification. The system SHALL NOT support mixed-mode (32-bit/64-bit) calling conventions.

- **FR-008**: The system MUST specify register usage conventions for function return addresses and frame pointers, including RSP (stack pointer) and RBP (base pointer) management rules.

- **FR-009**: The system MUST provide specifications for handling floating-point and vector register preservation, including which XMM/YMM/ZMM registers must be saved across function calls on each platform.

- **FR-010**: The system MUST define stack frame layout conventions, including parameter area placement, local variable allocation, and alignment padding requirements.

- **FR-011**: The system MUST specify red zone availability and usage rules, distinguishing SystemV's 128-byte red zone from Windows' prohibition of red zone access. The specification SHALL provide a query interface to determine red zone availability and size for compiler optimization decisions.

- **FR-012**: The system MUST provide register allocation priority guidance for efficient code generation, indicating preferred register usage orders for parameters and temporary values.

- **FR-013**: The system MUST specify alignment requirements for different data types (8-byte for pointers and 64-bit integers, 16-byte for SIMD types, etc.) affecting both stack layout and structure padding.

- **FR-014**: The system MUST define calling convention behavior for variadic functions, including register and stack parameter handling differences from fixed-parameter functions on each platform. Variadic function handling SHALL precisely match reference ABI specifications (SystemV ABI, Microsoft x64 calling convention) including floating-point register usage and AL register conventions where applicable.

- **FR-015**: The system MUST provide specifications verifiable against authoritative ABI documentation sources (Intel Software Developer Manuals, AMD64 ABI specification documents, Microsoft x64 calling convention documentation).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: ABI specifications MUST reflect current authoritative documentation from processor vendors (Intel, AMD) and operating system providers (Microsoft, System V).

- **NFR-002**: The specification interface MUST enable deterministic code generation, ensuring identical inputs produce identical assembly output across compilation runs.

- **NFR-003**: ABI rule queries MUST execute with negligible computational overhead (< 0.1% of total compilation time), essentially functioning as constant-time table lookups to avoid performance bottlenecks in the compiler's code generation pipeline.

- **NFR-004**: The specification system MUST facilitate future extensibility for additional platforms or ABI variants through modular design without requiring explicit versioning mechanisms or modifications to existing platform specifications.

- **NFR-005**: ABI specifications MUST be internally consistent, with no conflicting rules within a single platform's calling convention.

- **NFR-006**: The specification interface MUST leverage the type system to prevent invalid queries at compile-time, ensuring that unsupported register-platform combinations or invalid parameter configurations are rejected by the type checker rather than at runtime.

- **NFR-007**: The system MUST provide comprehensive logging and tracing capabilities for ABI decision-making processes to facilitate compiler debugging and code generation verification. This includes trace-level logging of register allocation decisions, parameter passing conventions selected, and stack layout calculations.

## Additional Considerations

### Verification and Validation

The correctness of ABI specifications can be systematically verified through:

1. **Documentation Cross-Reference**: Direct comparison with authoritative sources including:
   - Intel¬Æ 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals
   - AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual
   - System V Application Binary Interface AMD64 Architecture Processor Supplement
   - Microsoft x64 Calling Convention Documentation

2. **Behavioral Testing**: Generation of test assembly code and verification of interoperability with system libraries and operating system APIs.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Validation against reference compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC) to ensure conformance with industry-standard implementations.

### Platform-Specific Nuances

The specification must account for critical differences between platform ABIs:

- **Windows x64**: Requires 32-byte shadow space allocation for first four parameters even when passed in registers; does not support red zone; uses different register preservation rules.

- **SystemV**: Supports 128-byte red zone for leaf functions; uses different parameter register allocation order; requires 16-byte stack alignment before function calls.

- **macOS x86-64**: Generally follows System V AMD64 conventions but may have specific extensions or variations requiring explicit documentation.

### Success Metrics

Successful implementation of this specification enables:

1. **Compilation Correctness**: Generated assembly code correctly interfaces with system libraries across all supported platforms.

2. **Test Suite Validation**: Comprehensive test suites verify ABI compliance for all parameter types, return value conventions, and edge cases.

3. **Documentation Alignment**: Specifications demonstrably align with authoritative ABI documentation through direct citation and reference.

4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Compiler generates appropriate platform-specific code while maintaining consistent high-level semantics.
