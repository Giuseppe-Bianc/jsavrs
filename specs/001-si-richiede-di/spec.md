# Feature Specification: ASM Generation Components Improvement

**Feature Branch**: `001-si-richiede-di`  
**Created**: luned√¨ 22 settembre 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Si richiede di analizzare il codice situato nella cartella @src/asm. Tale codice contiene componenti utili alla generazione di programmi in linguaggio assembly (ASM) a 64 bit, compilabili con NASM, e progettati per garantire indipendenza dal sistema operativo. √à necessario migliorarne la struttura e le funzionalit√†, con particolare attenzione alla leggibilit√†, alla modularit√† e alla documentazione, al fine di incrementarne l'usabilit√† complessiva."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the jsavrs compiler project, I want to improve the assembly code generation components to make them more readable, modular, and well-documented so that future development and maintenance of the ASM generation features will be easier and more efficient.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer is working with the ASM generation code in the @src/asm directory, **When** they review the code structure and documentation, **Then** they should find it well-organized, clearly documented, and easy to understand.
2. **Given** a developer needs to extend or modify the ASM generation functionality, **When** they work with the modular components, **Then** they should be able to make changes without affecting unrelated parts of the system.
3. **Given** a new developer joins the project, **When** they review the ASM generation code, **Then** they should be able to quickly understand how to use and extend the components based on the provided documentation.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a developer tries to add support for a new instruction that isn't currently supported?
- How does the system handle the addition of new target operating systems or architectures?
- What is the process for extending the register or operand types while maintaining compatibility?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a clear and well-documented structure for ASM generation components in the @src/asm directory
- **FR-002**: System MUST organize ASM generation code into modular components that are loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- **FR-003**: System MUST include comprehensive documentation for all ASM generation components explaining their purpose and usage
- **FR-004**: System MUST support extensibility for adding new instructions, registers, and operands without major refactoring
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing NASM x86-64 assembly generation functionality
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear separation between different target operating systems (Linux, Windows, MacOS) while maintaining OS independence
- **FR-007**: System MUST include examples or templates demonstrating how to use the ASM generation components effectively

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ASM Generator**: Component responsible for generating NASM x86-64 assembly code with methods for adding sections, instructions, labels, and data definitions
- **Instructions**: Enum representing all supported assembly instructions with appropriate operands
- **Registers**: Enum representing all x86-64 registers with methods for size conversion and ABI identification
- **Operands**: Enum representing different types of operands (registers, immediates, memory references) with appropriate formatting
- **Target OS**: Enum representing supported operating systems with methods for handling OS-specific calling conventions
