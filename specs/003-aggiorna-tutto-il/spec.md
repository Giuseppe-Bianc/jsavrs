# Feature Specification: Assembly SSE and SSE2 Support

**Feature Branch**: `003-aggiorna-tutto-il`  
**Created**: mercoled√¨ 24 settembre 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Aggiorna tutto il codice assembly presente nella cartella @src/asm/ per aggiungere il supporto alle istruzioni SSE e SSE2, garantendo la compatibilit√† con il codice esistente. Mantieni intatta la logica attuale e il comportamento del programma, evitando regressioni o modifiche indesiderate alle routine gi√† implementate. Ottimizza dove possibile le sezioni vettoriali per migliorare le prestazioni, senza introdurre dipendenze esterne o rompere l'integrazione con le altre parti del progetto. Requisiti specifici: 1. Sostituisci le operazioni aritmetiche e logiche scalari con istruzioni SIMD quando possibile (ad esempio ADD, MUL, SUB su float/double con ADDPS, MULPS, ADDPD, MULPD). 2. Ottimizza i loop che operano su array o vettori usando registri XMM. 3. Mantieni commenti chiari vicino a tutte le modifiche SSE/SSE2 per facilitare la revisione, evidenziando eventuali ottimizzazioni, motivazioni e possibili effetti collaterali. 4. Inserisci eventuali fallback a istruzioni scalari se SSE/SSE2 non √® disponibile, garantendo compatibilit√† e prestazioni minime su CPU pi√π vecchie. 5. Mantieni la struttura dei file e le macro gi√† presente, assicurandoti che le modifiche non compromettano l'organizzazione esistente 6. Evidenzia eventuali parti del codice che non possono essere vettorizzate, specificando i motivi e suggerendo possibili alternative o ottimizzazioni. Non rimuovere codice esistente, ma integra SSE/SSE2 in modo incrementale, evitando refactor drastici. Mantieni il codice modulare, con sezioni chiaramente annotate per le ottimizzazioni SSE. Verifica ogni passo con test unitari, documentando le modifiche per facilitare future manutenzioni e debugging."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the jsavrs compiler system, I want the assembly code to support SSE and SSE2 instructions so that numerical computations can be optimized for better performance on modern processors while maintaining compatibility with existing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the compiler system with existing assembly routines, **When** I compile code that involves arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers, **Then** the generated assembly should use SIMD instructions where possible for better performance without changing the logical outcome.
2. **Given** the compiler system running on older processors without SSE/SSE2 support, **When** I execute the code, **Then** the fallback scalar instructions should be used to ensure continued functionality.
3. **Given** the assembly code with loops operating on arrays/vectors, **When** the code is compiled, **Then** the generated assembly should use XMM registers to optimize vector/array operations.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the processor doesn't support SSE/SSE2 instructions?
- How does the system handle mixed scalar and vector operations in the same routine?
- What happens when vectorization is not possible due to data dependencies or branching?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Error Handling
- System MUST gracefully fall back to scalar operations if processor detection for SSE/SSE2 capabilities fails
- System MUST automatically fallback to scalar implementation during compilation if target processor doesn't support SSE/SSE2 when flag is enabled

### Data Scale Assumptions
- Vectorization optimizations should target arrays/vectors with typically 8-16 elements per loop for optimal performance

### Constraints & Trade-offs
- Balance performance improvements with code maintainability when implementing SSE/SSE2 optimizations
- Prioritize maximizing runtime performance over minimizing compile time
- Implement compile-time flag with auto-detection for SSE/SSE2 functionality

- Ensure cross-platform instruction compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SSE/SSE2 Instructions**: Specialized assembly instructions for parallel processing of multiple data elements, providing performance improvements for vectorizable operations
- **Assembly Code**: Low-level code in the src/asm/ directory that will be modified to include SIMD optimizations while maintaining compatibility. The directory contains Rust modules (generator.rs, instruction.rs, operand.rs, register.rs) that likely generate or handle assembly code for the jsavrs compiler
- **XMM Registers**: 128-bit registers used by SSE/SSE2 instructions to process multiple data values simultaneously
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Alternative scalar instruction paths that execute when SSE/SSE2 capabilities are not available on the target processor
- **CPUID Instruction**: Processor instruction used to detect SSE/SSE2 support, targeting Pentium III+ processors
