# Research: Assembly SSE and SSE2 Support

## Decision: SIMD Implementation Strategy
**Rationale**: The jsavrs compiler requires significant performance improvements for vectorizable operations, specifically targeting a 20-50% execution speedup. Traditional scalar implementations are insufficient for this requirement, necessitating the use of SIMD instructions available in SSE and SSE2 extensions.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Pure Scalar Implementation**: 
   - Pros: Simpler to implement, no processor feature detection needed
   - Cons: Would not meet 20-50% performance improvement requirement
   - Rejected because: Performance goals cannot be achieved

2. **SSE/SSE2 Implementation**:
   - Pros: Provides necessary performance improvements, widely supported on modern processors
   - Cons: Requires processor feature detection, more complex implementation
   - Chosen because: Directly addresses performance requirements while maintaining compatibility

3. **Higher-Level Vector Libraries**:
   - Pros: Potential for cross-platform optimization, easier implementation
   - Cons: May not provide the required low-level control for optimal performance
   - Rejected because: Need for maximum performance requires direct instruction control

## Technology Research Findings

### Trait-Based Dispatch for SIMD/Scalar Selection
- **Decision**: Use trait-based dispatch to enable runtime selection between SIMD and scalar implementations
- **Rationale**: Provides maximum flexibility and code reuse while allowing compile-time optimization
- **Implementation**: Define traits for SIMD operations with separate implementations for SIMD-capable and scalar-only systems

### CPUID Instruction Usage for Processor Detection
- **Decision**: Use CPUID instruction to detect SSE/SSE2 support at runtime
- **Rationale**: Most reliable method for determining processor capabilities across different architectures
- **Implementation**: Create a feature detection module that queries CPUID flags for SSE/SSE2 support
- **Target**: Pentium III+ processor compatibility as minimum requirement

### Memory Alignment Handling
- **Decision**: Implement both aligned and unaligned memory access patterns
- **Rationale**: Ensures compatibility across different memory allocation strategies while maximizing performance where possible
- **Implementation**: Provide separate code paths for aligned (16-byte) and unaligned data operations

## Performance Impact
- **Expected Improvement**: 20-50% execution speedup for vectorizable operations, particularly on operations with 8-16 elements per loop
- **Measurable Targets**: 
  - Arithmetic operations on floating-point arrays: 30-40% improvement
  - Loop operations on vectors: 25-35% improvement
  - Overall program performance: 20-30% improvement for vectorizable code

## Architecture Integration Points
- **Intermediate Representation (IR) Phase**: Apply SIMD optimizations during IR generation to maximize optimization opportunities
- **Assembly Generation Module**: Update src/asm/ modules to generate appropriate SIMD instructions
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement automatic fallback to scalar operations when SSE/SSE2 is not available

## Security and Safety Considerations
- **Side-Channel Mitigation**: Implement protections against timing-based side-channel attacks in SIMD operations
- **Memory Safety**: Ensure SIMD operations maintain Rust's memory safety guarantees
- **Floating-Point Precision**: Provide configurable precision modes to handle differences between scalar and SIMD operations
