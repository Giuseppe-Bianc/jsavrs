# Research: Assembly SSE and SSE2 Support

## Decision: SSE/SSE2 Implementation Strategy
Based on the feature specification requirements, the implementation will leverage trait-based dispatch to provide both SSE/SSE2 optimized paths and scalar fallbacks. This approach ensures backward compatibility while maximizing performance on compatible processors, allowing seamless adaptation to the best available instruction set at runtime. It also simplifies maintenance by centralizing the logic for multiple execution paths and enables easy future extensions for newer SIMD architectures.

## Rationale
The JSAVRS compiler system needs to support both modern CPUs with SSE/SSE2 capabilities and older processors. Trait-based dispatch provides a clean abstraction that allows runtime selection of the appropriate implementation based on CPU capabilities while maintaining code modularity. This approach minimizes code duplication, simplifies maintenance, and enables seamless integration of future instruction sets without altering existing logic.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Compile-time only flags**: Would limit deployment flexibility
2. **Runtime CPUID checks with function pointers**: More complex implementation with potential performance overhead
3. **Separate binaries**: Would complicate deployment and distribution
4. **Trait-based dispatch** (selected): Provides optimal balance of performance, compatibility, and maintainability

## CPUID Detection Implementation
The system will use Rust's built-in CPU feature detection capabilities through the `std::arch` module to identify SSE/SSE2 support at runtime. This provides both safety and performance benefits, allowing optimized code paths to be executed only on compatible hardware while gracefully falling back on generic implementations when necessary. It ensures maximum efficiency without sacrificing portability.

## Memory Alignment Strategy
Implementing both aligned and unaligned memory access patterns to handle various data alignment scenarios. The system will detect alignment at runtime and select the most appropriate instruction sequence, optimizing performance while ensuring correctness across different architectures and memory layouts.
