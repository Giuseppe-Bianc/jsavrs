# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The documentation enhancement feature aims to update project documentation and code comments in the jsavrs compiler to thoroughly explain code behavior in all phases. This includes comprehensive documentation of functions, modules, and data structures to ensure the new documentation is detailed, precise, meticulous, and in-depth while remaining highly concise. The approach involves applying rustdoc standards consistently across the entire codebase with automated checks to maintain quality and currency.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75  
**Primary Dependencies**: rustdoc, cargo, clippy, criterion.rs (for benchmarks)  
**Storage**: File-based (documentation stored as comments in source code files)  
**Testing**: cargo test, insta snapshot testing  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)  
**Project Type**: Single project (compiler implementation)  
**Performance Goals**: No performance degradation to compilation process; documentation generation should not significantly impact build times  
**Constraints**: Must follow Rust documentation conventions (rustdoc); maintain backward compatibility with existing codebase  
**Scale/Scope**: Apply to entire jsavrs compiler codebase, covering all modules and components

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All implementations must follow the Core Principles of Safety First, Performance Excellence, Cross-Platform Compatibility, Modular Extensibility, Test-Driven Reliability, Snapshot Validation, and Documentation Rigor. Additionally, all community interactions must follow the Core Principles of Collaboration First, Respectful Communication, Shared Learning, Quality Through Community, and Transparency and Openness.

**Constitution Check Status**: PASS
- Safety First: N/A for documentation enhancement
- Performance Excellence: Documentation changes will not impact compilation performance
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Documentation is platform-agnostic
- Modular Extensibility: Documentation will follow existing modular structure
- Test-Driven Reliability: Documentation changes will be verified through CI checks
- Snapshot Validation: Documentation output will be validated using existing tools
- Documentation Rigor: This feature directly enhances documentation rigor
- Collaboration First: Documentation improvements will benefit all collaborators
- Respectful Communication: Documentation will follow project's communication standards
- Shared Learning: Better documentation enables shared learning across the team
- Quality Through Community: Documentation will be reviewed by community members
- Transparency and Openness: Documentation process will be transparent

**Post-Design Constitution Check**: PASS
- All design documents align with project constitution
- Documentation approach supports all core principles
- No violations introduced during design phase

```

**Structure Decision**: The jsavrs project follows a single project structure with modular organization by compiler phases. Documentation updates will be applied across all existing modules (lexer, parser, semantic analysis, IR, and codegen) following the existing architecture. The documentation enhancement will not change the source structure but will add comprehensive documentation to existing files.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
