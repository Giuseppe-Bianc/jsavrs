# Documentation Standards Contract for jsavrs Compiler

## Version
1.0.0

## Purpose
This contract defines the standards and requirements for documentation in the jsavrs compiler project. All documentation must adhere to these standards to ensure consistency, completeness, and quality across the codebase.

## Documentation Requirements

### 1. Completeness Requirements
- All public functions, methods, and modules must have documentation
- All struct fields must be documented
- All enum variants must be documented
- Complex algorithms must include explanations of their approach
- Error conditions and return values must be documented

### 2. Behavior in All Phases Requirement
Each documented component must explain its behavior during:
- Initialization: Setup, configuration, and preparation steps
- Runtime: Active processing, transformations, and operations
- Termination: Cleanup, resource release, and finalization

### 3. Documentation Quality Standards
- Detailed: Provide comprehensive information about the component
- Precise: Use exact and specific language
- Meticulous: Cover edge cases, error conditions, and all phases of behavior
- In-depth: Explain not just what the code does, but how and why
- Concise: Deliver information efficiently without unnecessary verbosity

### 4. rustdoc Format Requirements
All documentation must follow rustdoc conventions:
- Use triple slash comments (`///`) for public items
- Use double slash with exclamation (`//!`) for module-level documentation
- Include code examples using ```rust blocks
- Use markdown formatting for structure and emphasis
- Cross-reference related items using square brackets (`[Type]`, `[function]`)

### 5. Example Requirements
- Examples must be realistic and demonstrate actual usage
- Examples must compile and be tested with `cargo test --doc`
- Examples should cover common use cases
- Examples should demonstrate error handling when appropriate

## Validation Rules

### 1. Compilation Validation
- All documentation must compile without errors
- All code examples must be valid Rust code
- Cross-references to other items must be valid

### 2. Quality Metrics
- Documentation coverage must be measured and tracked
- Each function must have a description
- Complex functions must include usage examples
- Error conditions must be documented with guidance

### 3. Consistency Checks
- Terminology must be consistent throughout the codebase
- Formatting must follow rustdoc conventions
- Cross-references must use consistent naming

## API Contract for Documentation

### Public Function Documentation
```rust
/// [Brief description of function purpose]
/// 
/// # Behavior in Phases
/// * Initialization: [what happens during initialization]
/// * Runtime: [what happens during active processing]
/// * Termination: [what happens during cleanup]
/// 
/// # Parameters
/// * `param_name` - [description of parameter, including constraints]
/// 
/// # Returns
/// [Description of return value]
/// 
/// # Errors
/// [Description of possible errors]
/// 
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// [Example of how to use the function]
/// ```
pub fn function_name(param_name: Type) -> ReturnType {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Struct Documentation
```rust
/// [Brief description of struct purpose]
/// 
/// [Detailed description of the struct's role and behavior]
/// 
/// # Behavior in Phases
/// * Initialization: [how the struct is typically initialized]
/// * Runtime: [how the struct is used during its lifecycle]
/// * Termination: [how the struct is cleaned up or dropped]
/// 
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// [Example of how to create and use the struct]
/// ```
pub struct StructName {
    /// [Description of field purpose and constraints]
    pub field_name: FieldType,
}
```

### Module Documentation
```rust
//! [Brief description of module purpose]
//! 
//! [Detailed description of the module's role in the system]
//! 
//! # Phase-specific responsibilities:
//! * Initialization: [what the module does during setup]
//! * Runtime: [what the module does during active processing]
//! * Termination: [what the module does during cleanup]
//! 
//! # Important types:
//! * `TypeName` - [description of important type in module]
pub mod module_name { /* ... */ }
```

## Compliance Verification

### 1. Automated Checks
- Use `cargo doc` to verify documentation compiles
- Use `cargo test --doc` to verify examples work
- Use `cargo clippy` with documentation lints

### 2. Manual Reviews
- Technical accuracy review
- Readability and clarity check
- Completeness verification against requirements

## Enforcement
All pull requests containing code changes must also include appropriate documentation updates that comply with this contract. Code review process will verify compliance with these documentation standards before merging.
