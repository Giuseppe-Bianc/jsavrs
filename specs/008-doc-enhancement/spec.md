## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enhanced Documentation Access (Priority: P1)

Developers and maintainers need to quickly understand the existing codebase by accessing comprehensive, well-structured documentation that clearly explains the behavior of functions, modules, and systems throughout all phases of execution.

**Why this priority**: This is the most critical priority because it directly addresses the core need expressed: updating documentation and code comments to explain code behavior in all phases. Good documentation enables faster onboarding, easier maintenance, and better collaboration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that a developer unfamiliar with a specific module can understand its functionality and behavior by reading the documentation and code comments without needing to ask another team member.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs to understand a specific function, **When** they read the function's documentation and comments, **Then** they can understand what the function does, its inputs/outputs, and how it behaves during different execution phases.
2. **Given** a developer is debugging a complex system component, **When** they review the module documentation and inline comments, **Then** they can trace the component's behavior through all execution phases and understand how it integrates with other parts of the system.

### User Story 2 - Comprehensive Code Behavior Explanation (Priority: P2)

Maintainers need to have detailed explanations of how code behaves in different phases (e.g., initialization, runtime, termination) to effectively perform updates and modifications without breaking existing functionality.

**Why this priority**: This is important because understanding the behavior in all phases is specifically mentioned in the user's request. This level of detail helps prevent regressions during code changes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reviewing any piece of code documentation and verifying that it clearly describes what happens during each phase of execution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs to modify a system component, **When** they examine its documentation, **Then** they can understand how the component behaves in initialization, runtime, and cleanup phases.
2. **Given** an automated system needs to maintain consistency across codebase, **When** documentation standards are applied, **Then** all code includes phase-specific behavior explanations.

### User Story 3 - Concise Yet Thorough Documentation (Priority: P3)

Developers need documentation that is both detailed and concise, providing complete information without being overwhelming, to efficiently understand and work with the codebase.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the specific requirement that documentation should be "detailed, precise, meticulous, and in-depth while remaining highly concise."

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by evaluating whether documentation provides adequate detail for understanding while remaining readable and focused.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs to understand a complex algorithm, **When** they read the documentation and comments, **Then** they get a detailed explanation without being overwhelmed by unnecessary information.
2. **Given** a developer is pressed for time, **When** they need to understand a function quickly, **Then** they can identify the essential behavior from concise yet comprehensive comments.

### Edge Cases

- How does the system handle documentation for edge cases and error conditions in the code?
- How are outdated documentation updates detected and corrected through automated checks?
- How does the system handle documentation errors with graceful degradation?
- How are documentation changes rolled back when code changes are reverted?
