# Research: Documentation Enhancement for jsavrs Compiler

## Overview
This research document outlines the approach for enhancing the documentation and code comments in the jsavrs compiler project to thoroughly explain code behavior in all phases, ensuring the new documentation is detailed, precise, meticulous, and in-depth while remaining highly concise.

## Decision: Documentation Scope
**Rationale**: The decision to document all code components (not just public APIs) was made to ensure comprehensive understanding of the compiler's behavior across all phases - initialization, runtime, and termination. This approach aligns with the requirement to explain code behavior in all phases for maintainers and developers working on the internals.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Public APIs only: Would not meet the requirement to document behavior in all phases for internal components
- Critical path only: Would miss important components that may become critical later
- New code only: Would not address the existing undocumented codebase

## Decision: Documentation Tooling
**Rationale**: Using rustdoc as the primary documentation tooling leverages Rust's standard documentation system, which is already integrated into the development workflow. It allows for inline documentation that stays close to the code and can be easily maintained.

**Alternatives considered**:
- External documentation site: Would create a disconnect between code and documentation
- Separate documentation files: Would make it harder to keep docs in sync with code changes
- Wiki-based system: Would not be versioned with the codebase

## Decision: Automated Checks
**Rationale**: Implementing automated checks during CI/CD ensures documentation stays current with code changes. This approach prevents documentation from becoming outdated as the codebase evolves, which is critical for a compiler project where internals can be complex.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual checks: Would be inconsistent and time-consuming
- Periodic reviews: Would allow documentation to drift out of sync between reviews
- No checks: Would result in deteriorating documentation quality over time

## Decision: Documentation Quality Metrics
**Rationale**: Using measurable quality metrics provides objective ways to assess improvement and ensure documentation meets the requirements for being detailed, precise, meticulous, and concise. These metrics can be tracked over time to measure the success of the documentation enhancement effort.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual review process: Would be subjective and inconsistent
- User feedback based: Would be reactive rather than proactive
- No metrics: Would make it impossible to measure improvement

## Decision: Integration with Code Reviews
**Rationale**: Requiring no separate review process for documentation streamlines the workflow while still maintaining quality through the existing code review process. Documentation changes are reviewed as part of the overall code change, ensuring context is maintained.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate documentation review: Would add overhead and delay changes
- Maintainer approval: Would create bottlenecks
- Full code review: Would apply the same rigorous process as code changes

## Decision: Versioning Approach
**Rationale**: Versioning documentation with code ensures that documentation matches the code version being used. This is essential for a compiler where users may be working with different versions and need accurate documentation for their specific version.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate documentation versions: Would create complexity in matching docs to code versions
- Static documentation: Would not reflect ongoing improvements
- No versioning: Would make it impossible to track documentation changes

## Decision: Rollback Strategy
**Rationale**: Automatic rollback of documentation as part of code rollback ensures consistency between code and documentation during emergency fixes or problematic changes. This prevents users from having documentation that doesn't match the code.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual rollback: Would be error-prone and time-consuming during emergencies
- Maintain separate: Would result in documentation that doesn't match the code
- Archive only: Would still leave inconsistencies between code and documentation

## Implementation Approach
The documentation enhancement will follow these key principles:
1. Focus on explaining behavior in all phases (initialization, runtime, termination)
2. Ensure documentation is detailed yet concise
3. Apply rustdoc best practices consistently
4. Include examples where they clarify complex behavior
5. Document error handling and edge cases

## Research on Rust Documentation Best Practices
Based on research of Rust documentation standards and best practices:
- Use rustdoc format with triple slash comments (///)
- Include examples using ```rust code blocks
- Document all public interfaces with parameter and return value descriptions
- Use consistent language that matches Rust community conventions
- Where applicable, document performance characteristics
- For compiler phases, document the transformation that occurs in each phase
