# Data Model: Documentation Structure for jsavrs Compiler

## Overview
This document outlines the structure and organization of documentation within the jsavrs compiler project. Rather than traditional data models, this focuses on the documentation architecture that will explain code behavior in all phases.

## Documentation Components

### 1. Function-Level Documentation
- **Purpose**: Explain the behavior of individual functions during all execution phases
- **Structure**: 
  - Brief description of function purpose
  - Detailed explanation of behavior in initialization, runtime, and termination phases
  - Parameter descriptions with constraints and valid ranges
  - Return value descriptions
  - Error conditions and handling
  - Code examples when beneficial

### 2. Module-Level Documentation
- **Purpose**: Provide context for entire modules and their role in the compilation process
- **Structure**:
  - Overview of the module's purpose
  - Connection to other modules
  - Phase-specific responsibilities
  - Key data structures within the module
  - Important functions and their roles

### 3. Data Structure Documentation
- **Purpose**: Document complex data structures and their lifecycle
- **Structure**:
  - Definition and purpose of the data structure
  - Fields with type, purpose, and constraints
  - State transitions during the compiler's operation
  - Relationship to other data structures
  - Valid state combinations and invariants

### 4. System-Level Documentation
- **Purpose**: Explain how different components work together
- **Structure**:
  - Flow of data through the compiler
  - Interaction between phases
  - Entry and exit points
  - Configuration options and their effects
  - Performance considerations

## Documentation Standards

### Behavior in All Phases
Each documented component must explain its behavior during:
1. **Initialization Phase**: Setup, configuration, and preparation
2. **Runtime Phase**: Active processing, transformations, and operations
3. **Termination Phase**: Cleanup, resource release, and finalization

### Documentation Format
- Follow rustdoc conventions with triple slash comments
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include code examples where they clarify behavior
- Document both successful paths and error conditions
- Be concise while remaining complete

## Validation Rules

### Completeness Validation
- Every public function must have documentation
- Every module must have a module-level comment
- Complex data structures must have detailed field descriptions
- Error conditions must be documented

### Quality Validation
- Documentation must explain "why" not just "what"
- Examples must be relevant and clear
- Explanations must be accessible to developers unfamiliar with the code
- Language must be precise and unambiguous

## State Transitions (for stateful components)

### Documentation Lifecycle States
1. **Undocumented**: No documentation exists for the component
2. **Draft**: Initial documentation written, pending review
3. **Complete**: Documentation fully written and reviewed
4. **Outdated**: Documentation may not match current implementation
5. **Maintained**: Documentation kept in sync with implementation changes

## Relationships

### Linking Related Documentation
- Functions should cross-reference related data structures
- Modules should link to dependent modules
- Error handling documentation should link to the errors
- Examples should reference related examples

### Hierarchical Relationships
- Module documentation encompasses function documentation
- System documentation references module documentation
- Data structure documentation may be referenced by multiple functions
