# Specification Quality Checklist: Comprehensive Type Casting System Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ The specification maintains a user-centric focus describing type casting from the compiler user's perspective
- ✅ No implementation details are present; the spec describes WHAT needs to happen, not HOW
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (e.g., "compiler users need to convert boolean values")

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- ✅ All 20 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-020) are clearly defined and testable
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers exist - all requirements are fully specified with informed defaults based on standard compiler behavior
- ✅ All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "95% coverage", "O(1) time", "no more than 5% increase")
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic, focusing on observable outcomes (e.g., "warnings are generated for 100% of conversions")
- ✅ Each user story includes detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Comprehensive edge cases enumerated (10 specific scenarios covering overflow, NaN, Unicode, etc.)
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section excluding pointer types, custom types, and optimization concerns
- ✅ Dependencies section identifies all prerequisite modules and infrastructure
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 7 key assumptions about existing infrastructure and standards

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios and success criteria
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories cover the complete feature scope (P1: Numeric, P2: Bool/Char, P3: String)
- ✅ Each user story is independently testable and delivers standalone value
- ✅ Success criteria provide clear acceptance thresholds for completion
- ✅ Constraints section ensures maintainability without breaking changes

## Notes

The specification successfully makes informed assumptions rather than leaving gaps:
- Assumed IEEE 754 for floating-point (industry standard)
- Assumed Rust Unicode definition for char type (project context)
- Assumed string parsing requires runtime support (technical reality)
- Assumed overflow behavior applies consistently (logical consistency)

No implementation details were included in the specification. References to module names in Dependencies section are appropriate context references, not implementation prescriptions.

All requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria, enabling straightforward validation during implementation and testing phases.
