## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: Quale calling convention x86-64 dovrebbe essere supportata dal generatore? ‚Üí A: Entrambe le convenzioni (System V + Microsoft)
- Q: Quali tipi di dati deve supportare il generatore per le operazioni e l'allocazione memoria? ‚Üí A: Interi + float + puntatori + stringhe

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the jsavrs compiler, I want to generate executable assembly code from my compiled program's intermediate representation so that I can produce native x86-64 binaries that can be assembled and executed on target systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid IR representation from the jsavrs compiler, **When** the assembly generator is invoked, **Then** syntactically correct NASM assembly code is produced for x86-64 architecture
2. **Given** NASM assembly output from the generator, **When** processed by the NASM assembler, **Then** the assembly process completes successfully without syntax errors
3. **Given** complex IR with function calls and control flow, **When** assembly is generated, **Then** the output maintains correct program semantics and execution order
4. **Given** IR with variable declarations and operations, **When** assembly is generated, **Then** proper register allocation and memory management instructions are produced

### Edge Cases
- What happens when IR contains unsupported operations for x86-64 architecture? ‚Üí Generate stub code with TODO comments to maintain compilation flow
- How does the system handle memory alignment requirements for different data types?
- What occurs when register pressure exceeds available x86-64 registers?
- How are calling conventions properly implemented for function interoperability?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST transform jsavrs intermediate representation into valid x86-64 assembly code
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate assembly using NASM-compatible syntax and directives with modular output organized into separate sections (data, text, bss)
- **FR-003**: System MUST produce assembly that successfully assembles with NASM without syntax errors
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve program semantics and execution flow from the original IR
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) for integer types (8, 16, 32, 64 bit) and floating-point types (32, 64 bit)
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement both System V ABI (Unix/Linux) and Microsoft x64 calling conventions for cross-platform compatibility
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate appropriate memory management instructions for variable storage including integers, floats, pointers, and string data
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle control flow structures (loops, conditionals, jumps) correctly
- **FR-009**: System MUST allocate registers efficiently for temporary and local variables across all supported data types, applying basic optimization techniques to minimize register spilling
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate proper program entry points and exit sequences
- **FR-011**: System MUST produce human-readable assembly output with appropriate comments and labels
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle data type conversions and casting operations between integers, floating-point numbers, pointers, and string types
- **FR-013**: System MUST support basic I/O operations for program input and output
- **FR-014**: System MUST generate stub code with TODO comments when encountering unsupported or problematic IR constructs, allowing compilation to continue while marking areas requiring manual implementation
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement basic code optimizations including peephole optimizations and removal of redundant instructions to improve generated assembly quality
- **FR-016**: System MUST organize generated assembly code into clearly separated sections: .text for executable code, .data for initialized data, and .bss for uninitialized data
- **FR-017**: System MUST balance compilation speed with output code quality during assembly generation
- **FR-018**: System MUST support concurrent code generation for independent modules when applicable
- **FR-019**: System MUST resolve dependencies between IR modules before code generation
- **FR-020**: System MUST include basic debug information with symbol and line information in assembly output
- **FR-021**: System MUST generate position-independent code (PIC) for shared library compatibility

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Assembly generation process MUST balance compilation speed with output code quality
- **NFR-002**: System MUST support concurrent processing of independent modules during code generation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: The compiler's internal representation containing program structure, operations, control flow, and data declarations
- **Assembly Code**: The generated x86-64 NASM-compatible assembly instructions organized in modular sections (.text, .data, .bss) representing the executable program
- **Instruction Mapping**: The correspondence between IR operations and their x86-64 assembly equivalents
- **Register Allocation**: The assignment of program variables and temporaries to available x86-64 processor registers
- **Memory Layout**: The organization of program data, stack frames, and heap allocations in the generated assembly
- **Symbol Table**: The mapping of program identifiers to their assembly labels and memory locations
- **Control Flow Graph**: The representation of program execution paths and branching logic in assembly form
- **Optimization Engine**: The component responsible for applying peephole optimizations and removing redundant instructions from the generated assembly code
