## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the jsavrs compiler, I want to generate executable assembly code from my compiled program's intermediate representation so that I can produce native x86-64 binaries that can be assembled and executed on target systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid IR representation from the jsavrs compiler, **When** the assembly generator is invoked, **Then** syntactically correct NASM assembly code is produced for x86-64 architecture
2. **Given** NASM assembly output from the generator, **When** processed by the NASM assembler, **Then** the assembly process completes successfully without syntax errors
3. **Given** complex IR with function calls and control flow, **When** assembly is generated, **Then** the output maintains correct program semantics and execution order
4. **Given** IR with variable declarations and operations, **When** assembly is generated, **Then** proper register allocation and memory management instructions are produced
5. **Given** jsavrs IR containing unsupported or invalid constructs, **When** the generator encounters these constructs, **Then** the system generates stub code with standardized TODO comments, logs structured error information, continues processing remaining valid IR, and produces a compilation report with error summary and actionable recommendations
6. **Given** jsavrs IR with memory constraint violations or impossible register allocation scenarios, **When** the generator attempts code generation, **Then** the system gracefully degrades performance (using stack spilling), emits appropriate warnings with specific resource conflict details, and completes assembly generation with alternative strategies
7. **Given** jsavrs IR with source location metadata and debug level 2+ configuration, **When** assembly generation occurs, **Then** the system produces DWARF-compatible debug sections, maintains accurate IR-to-assembly mapping, generates complete symbol tables, and ensures debugger compatibility with GDB/LLDB for step-through debugging
8. **Given** jsavrs assembly output with debug information level 1+, **When** loaded by debugging tools, **Then** variable names are correctly resolved, function boundaries are accurately identified, and source line mapping provides ¬±2 line accuracy for debugging navigation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when IR contains unsupported operations for x86-64 architecture? ‚Üí Generate stub code with standardized TODO comments (format: `; TODO: Unsupported IR construct [type] - [reason]`), log error details to JSON output, continue compilation
- How does the system handle memory alignment requirements for different data types? ‚Üí Apply x86-64 alignment rules (1, 2, 4, 8 bytes), emit padding instructions, warn about performance implications
- What occurs when register pressure exceeds available x86-64 registers? ‚Üí Implement stack spilling with minimal performance impact, emit optimization suggestions, maintain register allocation statistics
- How are calling conventions properly implemented for function interoperability? ‚Üí Support System V ABI and Microsoft x64 calling conventions, validate parameter passing, handle return value management
- What happens when IR contains invalid memory references or null pointer dereferences? ‚Üí Generate safe assembly with bounds checking where possible, emit runtime safety comments, log potential issues
- How does the system handle compilation errors that prevent assembly generation? ‚Üí Maintain partial assembly output, provide detailed error location mapping, suggest corrective actions
- What occurs during concurrent module processing when dependencies are circular or unresolvable? ‚Üí Detect dependency cycles, generate appropriate error messages, provide dependency resolution suggestions
- How does the system handle debug information generation when IR lacks source location metadata? ‚Üí Generate synthetic debug markers based on IR structure, maintain function boundaries, provide best-effort symbol information, warn about limited debugging capability
- What happens when debug information generation conflicts with optimization passes? ‚Üí Prioritize debugging accuracy over optimization when debug level ‚â• 2, maintain optimization annotations for debug level 3, provide compilation flags to control debug vs optimization trade-offs
- How are debug symbols managed for inlined functions and optimized-away variables? ‚Üí Track inlining decisions in debug metadata, maintain variable lifetime information, generate DWARF inline info sections, provide symbolic debugger compatibility for optimized code
- What occurs when DWARF section generation fails or exceeds memory limits? ‚Üí Gracefully degrade to lower debug level, emit warning with specific resource constraints, maintain partial debug information, continue assembly generation with reduced debug fidelity
