# Tasks: Centralized Tracing System Configuration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-configure-the-tracing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md

**Tests**: The feature specification does not explicitly request test tasks, so tests will NOT be included in this task list.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 [P] Add tracing and tracing-subscriber dependencies to Cargo.toml
- [ ] T002 [P] Update CLI parser to handle --verbose flag for tracing in src/cli.rs
- [ ] T003 Create src/tracing/ directory structure

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core tracing infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Create src/tracing/mod.rs with module exports and public API
- [ ] T005 Create src/tracing/config.rs with TraceConfig, TraceLevel, TraceOutput, TraceFormat, TraceFilter, and CompilationPhase structs/enums from data-model.md
- [ ] T006 Create src/tracing/init.rs with centralized initialization logic for tracing
- [ ] T007 [P] Create src/tracing/subscriber.rs with custom subscriber implementation
- [ ] T008 [P] Create src/tracing/formatter.rs with custom formatter matching error_reporter.rs style
- [ ] T009 Export tracing API functions in src/lib.rs for library usage
- [ ] T010 Initialize tracing in src/main.rs when --verbose flag is active

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Developer Diagnoses Compilation Performance Issues (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable diagnostic tracing to identify which compilation phase is consuming the most time and resources, with detailed execution traces showing entry/exit of each phase with timing information.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by compiling a sample program with tracing enabled via command-line flag, examining the trace output to verify all compilation phases are instrumented, and confirming execution time data is captured for each phase.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Add #[instrument] attribute to lexer phase in src/lexer.rs
- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Add #[instrument] attribute to parser phase in src/parser/jsav_parser.rs
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Add #[instrument] attribute to semantic analysis phase in src/semantic/type_checker.rs
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Add #[instrument] attribute to IR generation phase in src/ir/generator.rs
- [ ] T015 [US1] Add #[instrument] attribute to assembly generation phase in src/asm/generator.rs (if exists)
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add timing information to trace spans in all compilation phases
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add execution path information to traces when errors occur
- [ ] T018 [US1] Add file identification in trace output for multiple file compilation

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 4 - Automated Test Suite Validates Compiler Correctness (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Capture detailed trace information only when tests fail, helping developers quickly diagnose test failures without overwhelming log output during successful test runs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the test suite with conditional tracing enabled, verifying that successful tests produce minimal output while failed tests automatically capture and display detailed traces.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T019 [US4] Update test infrastructure to enable tracing on test failure
- [ ] T020 [P] [US4] Create test helper functions in tests/tracing_tests.rs for trace output validation
- [ ] T021 [US4] Implement conditional tracing in test environment
- [ ] T022 [US4] Add trace identification for specific test cases and files
- [ ] T023 [US4] Minimize trace output for successful tests

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 4 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 2 - System Administrator Monitors Production Compiler Behavior (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Provide configurable trace levels that can be adjusted based on operational needs, with only events at or above configured level appearing in output and minimal performance overhead.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring different trace levels (error, warning, info, debug, trace) and verifying that only events at or above the configured level appear in output, with minimal performance overhead at higher levels.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T024 [US2] Implement trace level configuration through command-line arguments
- [ ] T025 [US2] Implement trace level configuration through environment variables
- [ ] T026 [US2] Add programmatic API for trace level configuration
- [ ] T027 [US2] Implement performance benchmarking to validate overhead targets
- [ ] T028 [US2] Add trace output destination configuration (stdout, stderr, file)
- [ ] T029 [US2] Ensure performance overhead is < 10% for maximum-verbosity tracing

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1, 4 AND 2 should all work independently

---

## Phase 6: User Story 3 - Core Library Consumer Integrates Tracing Context (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable propagation of trace context between applications embedding the jsavrs library and compiler operations to maintain end-to-end visibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a minimal application that calls the jsavrs library API, initializing a custom trace context, and verifying that compiler operations inherit and propagate that context correctly.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T030 [US3] Create public API for library consumers to initialize custom trace context
- [ ] T031 [US3] Implement trace context propagation between application and compiler
- [ ] T032 [US3] Add correlation of related events across application and compiler boundaries
- [ ] T033 [US3] Ensure compiler operates with sensible defaults when no explicit trace initialization is provided

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T034 [P] Add comprehensive documentation for tracing API in src/tracing/mod.rs
- [ ] T035 [P] Update README.md with tracing usage examples
- [ ] T036 [P] Create examples/tracing_usage.rs with practical examples
- [ ] T037 Add tracing overhead benchmarks to benches/jsavrs_benchmark.rs
- [ ] T038 Implement graceful degradation when trace output destination unavailable
- [ ] T039 Ensure tracing continues with warning when initialization fails
- [ ] T040 Run quickstart.md validation to verify all examples work

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories 
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Can integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Can integrate with previous stories but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all instrumentation tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Add #[instrument] attribute to lexer phase in src/lexer.rs"
Task: "Add #[instrument] attribute to parser phase in src/parser/jsav_parser.rs"
Task: "Add #[instrument] attribute to semantic analysis phase in src/semantic/type_checker.rs"
Task: "Add #[instrument] attribute to IR generation phase in src/ir/generator.rs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 4
   - Developer C: User Story 2
   - Developer D: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
