# Implementation Plan: Centralized Tracing System Configuration

**Branch**: `005-configure-the-tracing` | **Date**: 2025-10-11 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-configure-the-tracing/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive, human-readable tracing system for the jsavrs compiler that provides detailed runtime insights during compilation. The system will leverage Rust's `tracing` and `tracing-subscriber` crates to instrument all major compilation phases (lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, IR generation, and assembly generation). The tracing output format will closely align with the existing error reporting system defined in `src/error/error_reporter.rs`, using the `console` crate for consistent colored and styled output. Logging verbosity will be configurable through the existing `--verbose` CLI flag, with automatic failover to stderr when trace output becomes unavailable, and graceful degradation when initialization fails.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 2024 edition (version 0.1.0)  
**Primary Dependencies**: 
- `tracing` v0.1 (core tracing library with instrumentation primitives)
- `tracing-subscriber` v0.3 (subscriber implementations for trace collection)
- `console` v0.16.1 (already in use for error reporting, provides styling capabilities)
- `clap` v4.5.48 (CLI parsing, already integrated with `--verbose` flag)
- `thiserror` v2.0.17 (error handling integration)

**Storage**: Not applicable (traces output to stdout/stderr/files, not persistent storage)

**Testing**: 
- `cargo test` (standard Rust testing framework)
- `insta` v1.43.2 (snapshot testing for trace output validation)
- `criterion` v0.7.0 (performance benchmarking to validate overhead targets)

**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) - already tested via existing CI

**Project Type**: Single binary + library (compiler infrastructure)

**Performance Goals**: 
- Zero overhead when tracing is disabled (compile-time elimination)
- < 5% compilation time overhead with maximum-verbosity tracing enabled
- Sub-millisecond granularity for timing measurements
- < 50MB trace output for typical compilation scenarios

**Constraints**: 
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI interface
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing error reporting system
- Must not modify existing compilation logic or data structures
- Must support both library and binary usage modes
- Must be configurable at runtime through CLI and programmatically through API

**Scale/Scope**: 
- Instrument 5 major compilation phases (lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, IR generator, assembly generator)
- Support filtering by phase, file, or custom criteria
- Handle concurrent compilation scenarios (future multi-threading support)
- Maintain trace context across ~15-20 major modules in src/ directory

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All implementations must follow the Core Principles of Safety First, Performance Excellence, Cross-Platform Compatibility, Modular Extensibility, Test-Driven Reliability, Snapshot Validation, and Documentation Rigor. Additionally, all community interactions must follow the Core Principles of Collaboration First, Respectful Communication, Shared Learning, Quality Through Community, and Transparency and Openness.

### Constitution Compliance Assessment

✅ **Safety First**: The tracing implementation will leverage Rust's type system and ownership model. All trace data handling will be memory-safe, with no unsafe code unless absolutely necessary and properly documented.

✅ **Performance Excellence**: Zero-cost abstractions when tracing is disabled (compile-time feature flags), with measured overhead < 10% when fully enabled. Performance will be validated through Criterion benchmarks.

✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The `tracing` and `tracing-subscriber` crates are platform-agnostic. Console styling will respect platform-specific terminal capabilities. No platform-specific dependencies introduced.

✅ **Modular Extensibility**: Tracing infrastructure will be implemented as a separate module (`src/tracing/`) with clean interfaces. Individual compilation phases can opt-in to instrumentation without coupling. Custom subscribers can be added for different output formats.

✅ **Test-Driven Reliability**: Comprehensive test suite including unit tests for trace initialization, integration tests for end-to-end tracing, snapshot tests (via `insta`) for output format consistency, and performance regression tests.

✅ **Snapshot Validation**: All human-readable trace output will be validated using `insta` snapshot tests to ensure consistent formatting and catch unintended changes.

✅ **Documentation Rigor**: Comprehensive documentation will be created including `research.md` (technical approach analysis), `data-model.md` (trace data structures), and inline rustdoc comments for all public APIs.

**No constitution violations identified.** This implementation aligns fully with all established principles.

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure is maintained. The tracing system is implemented as a new module within the existing `src/` directory tree. This follows the existing modular organization pattern where each major subsystem (error, ir, parser, semantic, etc.) has its own directory. The tracing module will provide centralized initialization and configuration, while individual compilation phases will instrument their operations using the `#[instrument]` attribute macro from the `tracing` crate.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

**No complexity violations identified.** The tracing implementation aligns fully with all constitutional principles and does not introduce unnecessary complexity.
