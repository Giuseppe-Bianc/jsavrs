# Feature Specification: Centralized Tracing System Configuration

**Feature Branch**: `005-configure-the-tracing`  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Configure the tracing system within the project to ensure complete and consistent integration. Include centralized tracing initialization, connection to the core library and executable modules, and automatic propagation of the tracing context across the various components. Then verify correct operation through integration tests and sample logs, ensuring that every part of the system can be monitored uniformly and transparently."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Diagnoses Compilation Performance Issues (Priority: P1)

A compiler developer notices that certain source files take longer to compile than expected. They need to enable diagnostic tracing to identify which compilation phase (lexing, parsing, type checking, IR generation, or assembly generation) is consuming the most time and resources.

**Why this priority**: Core diagnostic capability that directly impacts development efficiency and compiler optimization efforts. Without tracing, performance bottlenecks are nearly impossible to identify systematically.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by compiling a sample program with tracing enabled via command-line flag, examining the trace output to verify all compilation phases are instrumented, and confirming execution time data is captured for each phase.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a source file requiring compilation, **When** the developer runs the compiler with tracing enabled, **Then** detailed execution traces are produced showing entry/exit of each compilation phase with timing information
2. **Given** tracing is enabled, **When** an error occurs during compilation, **Then** the trace output includes the complete execution path leading to the error with relevant context
3. **Given** multiple files being compiled, **When** tracing is active, **Then** each file's compilation is tracked independently with clear identification in the trace output

---

### User Story 2 - System Administrator Monitors Production Compiler Behavior (Priority: P2)

A system administrator running the compiler in a production build environment needs to collect operational metrics and diagnostic information without impacting compilation performance. They want configurable trace levels that can be adjusted based on operational needs.

**Why this priority**: Essential for production observability and operational excellence, but secondary to basic diagnostic capabilities. Production monitoring becomes critical only after the compiler is being used at scale.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring different trace levels (error, warning, info, debug, trace) and verifying that only events at or above the configured level appear in output, with minimal performance overhead at higher levels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a production environment configuration, **When** trace level is set to "error", **Then** only critical errors are logged and performance overhead is negligible (< 1% compilation time increase)
2. **Given** trace level is set to "info", **When** compilations complete successfully, **Then** summary information about each compilation phase is logged without detailed step-by-step traces
3. **Given** trace output destination is configured, **When** compilation runs, **Then** traces are written to the specified destination (stdout, stderr, file, or structured log collector) in the expected format

---

### User Story 3 - Core Library Consumer Integrates Tracing Context (Priority: P3)

A developer building tools on top of the jsavrs library needs to integrate the compiler's tracing system with their own application's observability infrastructure. They want to propagate trace context between their application and compiler library calls to maintain end-to-end visibility.

**Why this priority**: Important for ecosystem development and third-party tool integration, but not critical for standalone compiler functionality. Most users run the compiler binary directly rather than embedding the library.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a minimal application that calls the jsavrs library API, initializing a custom trace context, and verifying that compiler operations inherit and propagate that context correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an application embedding the jsavrs library, **When** the application initializes tracing with custom context, **Then** compiler operations inherit that context and traces can be correlated across application and compiler boundaries
2. **Given** trace context propagation is configured, **When** multiple library calls are made sequentially, **Then** all operations share a common trace identifier allowing correlation of related events
3. **Given** the library is used without explicit trace initialization, **When** compiler functions are called, **Then** tracing operates with sensible defaults without requiring configuration from the caller

---

### User Story 4 - Automated Test Suite Validates Compiler Correctness (Priority: P1)

The continuous integration system runs the compiler test suite and needs to capture detailed trace information only when tests fail, helping developers quickly diagnose test failures without overwhelming the log output during successful test runs.

**Why this priority**: Critical for maintaining development velocity and code quality. Test failures must be diagnosable quickly to prevent blocking the development pipeline.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the test suite with conditional tracing enabled, verifying that successful tests produce minimal output while failed tests automatically capture and display detailed traces.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an automated test environment, **When** all compiler tests pass, **Then** trace output is suppressed or minimized to summary information only
2. **Given** a test fails, **When** the test runner examines the failure, **Then** detailed trace information for the failed test case is automatically captured and included in the test output
3. **Given** integration tests that compile multiple files, **When** tracing is enabled for testing, **Then** trace output clearly identifies which test case and which file within that test case produced each trace event

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when trace output destination becomes unavailable (disk full, network log collector unreachable)?
- How does the system handle trace initialization failures without crashing the compiler?
- What is the behavior when trace levels are dynamically changed during long-running compilation processes?
- How are traces handled when compilation is interrupted (Ctrl+C, system signals)?
- What happens with trace context propagation when compilation uses parallel processing or multi-threading?
- How does the system prevent trace output from corrupting compiler binary output to stdout?

## Scope *(mandatory)*

### In Scope

- Centralized trace initialization for both binary executable and library usage
- Instrumentation of all existing compilation phases (lexer, parser, type checker, IR generator, assembly generator)
- Multiple output format support (human-readable styled console output, structured JSON)
- Configurable verbosity levels with runtime filtering
- Integration with existing error reporting infrastructure
- Performance benchmarking to validate overhead targets
- Integration tests validating trace correctness and completeness
- Documentation with practical examples and typical output samples
- Graceful error handling for trace system failures

### Out of Scope

- Real-time trace visualization or interactive debugging UI
- Distributed tracing across network boundaries (compiler is single-process)
- Historical trace storage or analysis system
- Custom trace backends beyond file and console output
- Automatic performance regression detection (beyond manual benchmark comparison)
- Trace-based code coverage analysis
- Binary instrumentation or dynamic tracing of unmodified code

### Boundaries

The tracing system focuses exclusively on compiler operations and does not extend to user programs being compiled. Traces capture compiler behavior, not the execution of compiled programs. The system assumes single-machine operation and does not address distributed compilation scenarios.

## Assumptions *(optional)*

- The console crate is already available as a dependency (confirmed in Cargo.toml) and provides sufficient styling capabilities
- Compilation is single-threaded or uses explicit parallelism where trace context can be propagated manually
- Trace output volumes will remain manageable (< 1GB per compilation) for typical use cases
- Developers have basic familiarity with structured logging concepts
- The existing error_reporter.rs format is well-established and should be used as the model for trace output styling
- Performance benchmarks will use the existing criterion-based benchmark suite (jsavrs_benchmark.rs)

## Dependencies *(optional)*

- **tracing crate (v0.1)**: Core tracing library providing instrumentation primitives
  - Spans for representing periods of time
  - Events for representing instantaneous points in time
  - `#[instrument]` attribute macro for automatic function instrumentation
  - Hierarchical span contexts with automatic propagation
- **tracing-subscriber crate (v0.3)**: Subscriber implementations for collecting trace data
  - `fmt::Layer` for human-readable console output
  - `Registry` for composing multiple subscribers
  - `EnvFilter` for runtime filtering based on environment variables
  - Support for JSON, compact, and pretty formatting modes
- **console crate**: Already in use for error reporting, will be leveraged for trace output formatting
- **Existing benchmark infrastructure**: criterion-based benchmarks for performance validation
- **Existing test infrastructure**: insta snapshot testing for validating trace output consistency
- **Error reporting system**: Integration point for correlating errors with trace context

### Tracing Crate Technical Reference

#### Core Concepts

The `tracing` ecosystem is built around two fundamental concepts:

1. **Spans**: Represent periods of time during which a program is executing in a particular context. Spans form a tree structure, with each span potentially containing child spans.

2. **Events**: Represent instantaneous points in time. Events occur within the context of the currently active span(s).

#### Initialization Patterns

**Global Subscriber (Recommended for Applications)**:
```rust
use tracing_subscriber;

fn main() {
    // Simple initialization with default configuration
    tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();
    
    // Or with custom configuration
    tracing_subscriber::fmt()
        .with_max_level(tracing::Level::TRACE)
        .with_target(false)
        .with_thread_ids(true)
        .with_line_number(true)
        .init();
}
```

**Layered Subscriber (Recommended for Libraries and Complex Scenarios)**:
```rust
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;
use tracing_subscriber::{fmt, EnvFilter};

fn init_tracing() {
    let fmt_layer = fmt::layer()
        .with_target(false)
        .compact();
    
    let filter_layer = EnvFilter::try_from_default_env()
        .or_else(|_| EnvFilter::try_new("info"))
        .unwrap();

    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(filter_layer)
        .with(fmt_layer)
        .init();
}
```

#### Instrumentation Patterns

**Automatic Function Instrumentation**:
```rust
use tracing::instrument;

#[instrument]
pub fn compile_file(path: &str) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Automatically creates span named "compile_file" with field "path"
    tracing::info!("Starting compilation");
    // ... compilation logic ...
    Ok(())
}

// For async functions
#[instrument]
async fn async_operation() -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Span is properly attached to the future
    tracing::debug!("Processing async operation");
    Ok(())
}
```

**Manual Span Creation**:
```rust
use tracing::{span, Level};

pub fn process_module() {
    let span = span!(Level::INFO, "module_processing", module = "lexer");
    let _enter = span.enter();
    
    // All events within this scope are associated with the span
    tracing::info!("Module processing started");
    // ... processing logic ...
}
```

**Event Logging**:
```rust
use tracing::{debug, info, warn, error};

// Simple events
info!("Compilation phase complete");

// Events with fields
debug!(file = ?path, lines = line_count, "File parsed successfully");

// Error events
error!(error = %err, "Compilation failed");
```

#### Output Formatting Options

**Compact Format** (minimal, single-line output):
```rust
tracing_subscriber::fmt()
    .compact()
    .init();
// Output: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z INFO compile_file: Starting compilation path="/src/main.rs"
```

**Pretty Format** (human-readable, multi-line with colors):
```rust
tracing_subscriber::fmt()
    .pretty()
    .init();
// Output:
//   2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z  INFO compile_file{path="/src/main.rs"}: Starting compilation
//     at src/compiler.rs:42
```

**JSON Format** (structured, machine-readable):
```rust
tracing_subscriber::fmt()
    .json()
    .init();
// Output: {"timestamp":"2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z","level":"INFO","target":"compiler","fields":{"message":"Starting compilation","path":"/src/main.rs"}}
```

#### Filtering Configuration

**Environment Variable Based**:
```rust
use tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter;

// Reads from RUST_LOG environment variable
// Example: RUST_LOG=debug,my_crate::module=trace
let filter = EnvFilter::from_default_env();
```

**Programmatic Filtering**:
```rust
use tracing_subscriber::filter::LevelFilter;

tracing_subscriber::fmt()
    .with_max_level(LevelFilter::INFO)
    .init();
```

**Per-Module Filtering**:
```rust
let filter = EnvFilter::new("info")
    .add_directive("my_crate::lexer=debug".parse().unwrap())
    .add_directive("my_crate::parser=trace".parse().unwrap());
```

#### Performance Considerations

1. **Zero-Cost When Disabled**: Events and spans that are filtered out have minimal runtime cost
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Field values are only computed if the event/span is enabled
3. **Efficient Span Context**: Span context propagation uses thread-local storage for minimal overhead

#### Integration with Error Reporting

The tracing system can be integrated with error handling by capturing span context when errors occur:

```rust
use tracing::error_span;

pub fn compile() -> Result<(), CompileError> {
    let span = error_span!("compilation");
    let _enter = span.enter();
    
    match parse_source() {
        Ok(ast) => Ok(()),
        Err(e) => {
            // Error event automatically includes span context
            tracing::error!(error = %e, "Parse failed");
            Err(e.into())
        }
    }
}
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Use `#[instrument]` for public APIs**: Provides automatic tracing without manual span management
2. **Choose appropriate span levels**:
   - `TRACE`: Very detailed, low-level information
   - `DEBUG`: Detailed information for debugging
   - `INFO`: General informational messages about execution flow
   - `WARN`: Warnings about potential issues
   - `ERROR`: Error events that should always be captured
3. **Include relevant context as fields**: Attach important data to spans and events
4. **Avoid expensive operations in field values**: Use `?` or `%` to defer formatting
5. **Use meaningful span names**: Should clearly identify what operation is being traced
6. **Keep span scope tight**: Enter and exit spans close to the actual work being done

## Risks & Mitigation *(optional)*

### Risk 1: Performance Overhead Exceeds Acceptable Limits

**Impact**: High - Would prevent adoption of tracing in performance-sensitive scenarios

**Likelihood**: Medium - Modern tracing libraries are well-optimized, but improper instrumentation could introduce overhead

**Mitigation**: 
- Implement compile-time feature flag to completely disable tracing in release builds if needed
- Use zero-cost abstractions and lazy evaluation for trace message construction
- Establish performance benchmarks early and gate implementation on meeting overhead targets
- Profile trace-enabled builds to identify and optimize hotspots

### Risk 2: Trace Output Interferes with Compiler Output

**Impact**: High - Could break tools expecting specific compiler output format

**Likelihood**: Low - Can be prevented through careful stream management

**Mitigation**:
- Always send traces to stderr by default, reserving stdout for compiler output
- Provide explicit configuration for trace output destination
- Add integration tests validating output stream separation
- Document output stream conventions clearly

### Risk 3: Trace Context Propagation Complexity in Multi-threaded Code

**Impact**: Medium - May limit tracing effectiveness in future parallel compilation features

**Likelihood**: Medium - Thread-local context propagation requires careful design

**Mitigation**:
- Design trace context API to support both thread-local and explicit propagation patterns
- Document threading considerations and propagation requirements for future parallel work
- Include examples of correct context propagation in concurrent scenarios
- Defer full multi-threading support if it would delay initial implementation

### Risk 4: Integration Test Maintenance Burden

**Impact**: Low - Test maintenance could slow future development

**Likelihood**: Medium - Trace output format may evolve, breaking snapshot tests

**Mitigation**:
- Use insta snapshot testing with redaction support to ignore volatile data (timestamps, memory addresses)
- Focus tests on structural correctness rather than exact output matching
- Provide test utilities to simplify trace validation in new tests

## Non-Functional Requirements *(optional)*

### Performance

- Tracing system with zero-cost when disabled (compile-time or runtime based on optimization level)
- Maximum 10% overhead for full-verbosity tracing in debug builds
- Maximum 5% overhead for info-level tracing in debug builds
- Trace message construction should use lazy evaluation to avoid string formatting when traces are filtered

### Reliability

- Trace system failures must not cause compilation failures
- Graceful degradation when output destinations become unavailable
- No data loss for critical error traces (buffered writes with flush on error)

### Usability

- Default trace configuration provides useful information without overwhelming output
- Trace output uses clear, consistent terminology matching compiler phase names
- Colored output improves readability but degrades gracefully on non-terminal outputs

### Maintainability

- Instrumentation should be added through minimal code changes (ideally via decorators or macros)
- Trace configuration should be centralized in a single module
- Integration with existing error reporting should reuse formatting logic where possible
