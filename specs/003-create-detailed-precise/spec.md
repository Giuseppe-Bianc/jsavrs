## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs to be tested and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid specifying HOW tests are implemented
- üë• Written for QA engineers and developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What minimum code coverage percentage should the test suite achieve for the TypePromotionEngine module? ‚Üí A: 100% line coverage (complete coverage required)
- Q: Should the test suite include actual concurrent execution tests, or only verify that the engine's design properties support thread-safe usage? ‚Üí A: Include concurrent execution tests with multiple threads
- Q: How should tests be organized within the test file? ‚Üí A: Group by function tested (analyze_binary_promotion, insert_promotion_casts, etc.)
- Q: Should the test suite use snapshot testing or explicit assertions? ‚Üí A: Hybrid approach (snapshots for complex outputs, assertions for critical properties)
- Q: How exhaustive should testing be for helper methods like is_signed_integer(), is_unsigned_integer(), and get_bit_width()? ‚Üí A: Test each method with all IrType variants (complete exhaustive coverage)
- Q: Should tests be added to existing ir_type_promotion_tests.rs or create new ir_type_promotion_engine_tests.rs? ‚Üí A: Create new ir_type_promotion_engine_tests.rs file as specified in user description
- Q: Should the tests mock or isolate the PromotionMatrix dependency, or test with real PromotionMatrix instances? ‚Üí A: Create both integration and unit tests with real and mocked matrix
- Q: Should helper methods (is_signed_integer, is_unsigned_integer, get_bit_width) be tested separately or as part of TypePromotionEngine? ‚Üí A: Test these methods as part of TypePromotionEngine functionality only
- Q: Should tests verify specific warning message content or just presence/absence? ‚Üí A: Test detailed message content and format for each warning type
- Q: Should cast insertion tests verify logical correctness, IR generation, or both? ‚Üí A: Test both logical correctness and some IR generation verification

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a QA engineer working on the jsavrs compiler, I need a comprehensive test suite for the Type Promotion Engine that validates all type promotion scenarios, including edge cases and corner cases, to ensure the compiler correctly handles type conversions in binary operations across all supported types.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a Type Promotion Engine instance, **When** analyzing binary operations with identical types, **Then** the engine returns correct promotion results with no casts required

2. **Given** a Type Promotion Engine with various type combinations, **When** analyzing binary operations between different numeric types, **Then** the engine determines the correct target type according to the type promotion hierarchy

3. **Given** operands with signed and unsigned integers of same width, **When** analyzing for type promotion, **Then** the engine generates appropriate signedness change warnings

4. **Given** type conversions that may lose precision, **When** analyzing promotions, **Then** the engine generates precision loss warnings with accurate estimates

5. **Given** type conversions that may overflow, **When** analyzing promotions, **Then** the engine generates overflow warnings for the appropriate operations

6. **Given** promotion analysis results with required casts, **When** inserting promotion casts into IR, **Then** the engine creates appropriate cast instructions and returns promoted values

### Edge Cases

**Type Boundary Cases:**
- What happens when promoting between the smallest and largest integer types (I8 to I64, U8 to U64)?
- How does the system handle promotion between I64 and U64 (same width, different signedness)?
- What occurs when converting maximum/minimum values that approach type boundaries?

**Float-Integer Boundary Cases:**
- How are floating-point special values (NaN, Infinity, -Infinity) handled in conversions?
- What happens when converting integers that cannot be exactly represented in float types?
- How does precision loss estimation work for large integers to F32 conversion?

**Promotion Matrix Edge Cases:**
- How does the engine handle type pairs not explicitly defined in the promotion matrix?
- What happens with identity promotions (type to itself)?
- How are bidirectional promotions handled (A to B vs B to A)?

**Operation-Specific Cases:**
- How do comparison operations differ from arithmetic operations in promotion?
- What special handling exists for division operations with potential overflow?
- How are bitwise operations handled with mixed signed/unsigned types?

**Corner Cases:**
- Empty or null values in promotion analysis
- Promotion analysis with invalid type combinations
- Multiple cascading warnings in a single promotion
- Cast insertion with missing or invalid function contexts
