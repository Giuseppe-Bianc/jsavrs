//! Performance benchmarking for assembly generation
//! Based on: T039 Performance benchmarking with criterion.rs and memory usage validation (â‰¤2x IR size constraint) in benches/assembly_generation_bench.rs

// Note: This is a placeholder for benchmarking. In a complete implementation,
// we would use criterion.rs for proper benchmarking. This requires adding
// criterion as a dev dependency and setting up the benchmark harness.
