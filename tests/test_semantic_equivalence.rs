//! Integration test for semantic equivalence validation
//! Based on: T012 [P] Integration test semantic equivalence validation in tests/test_semantic_equivalence.rs
//!
//! This test verifies that the generated assembly preserves the semantics of the original IR.
//! The test is designed to fail initially (before implementation) to ensure TDD compliance.

//use jsavrs::asm::generator::AssemblyGenerator;

// Test placeholder - will test semantic equivalence after implementation
#[test]
fn test_semantic_equivalence() {
    // This test documents the expected semantic equivalence validation
    // It will verify that:
    // - Execution of IR produces same results as execution of generated assembly
    // - All side effects are preserved
    // - Memory operations behave identically
    // - Control flow maintains the same behavior
    
    // NOTE: This test is expected to fail initially until semantic validation is implemented
    // This is part of the TDD approach required by the task plan
