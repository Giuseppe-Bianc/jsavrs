//! Integration test for cross-platform ABI differences
//! Based on: T011 [P] Integration test cross-platform ABI differences in tests/test_cross_platform_abi.rs
//!
//! This test verifies that the assembly generator produces correct ABI-compliant code for different platforms.
//! The test is designed to fail initially (before implementation) to ensure TDD compliance.

// use jsavrs::asm::generator::AssemblyGenerator;

// Test placeholder - will test cross-platform ABI after implementation
#[test]
fn test_cross_platform_abi() {
    // This test documents the expected cross-platform ABI behavior
    // It will verify that the generator produces:
    // - Windows x64 ABI compliant code (shadow space, parameter registers)
    // - System V ABI compliant code (parameter registers, stack alignment)
    // - Proper symbol naming conventions for each platform
    
    // NOTE: This test is expected to fail initially until ABI implementations are complete
    // This is part of the TDD approach required by the task plan
    
    println!("Cross-platform ABI test defined");
