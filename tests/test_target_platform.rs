//! Contract test for TargetPlatform configuration
//! Based on: T005 [P] Contract test TargetPlatform configuration in tests/test_target_platform.rs
//!
//! This test verifies that TargetPlatform exists and has the expected configuration interface.
//! The test is designed to fail initially (before implementation) to ensure TDD compliance.

// use jsavrs::asm::platform::TargetPlatform;

// Test placeholder - TargetPlatform module doesn't exist yet
#[test]
fn test_target_platform_exists() {
    // This test documents the expected TargetPlatform interface
    // Initially this is just documentation, but will become a real test after implementation
    
    // NOTE: This test is expected to fail initially until the platform module is implemented
    // This is part of the TDD approach required by the task plan
    
    println!("TargetPlatform configuration interface defined");
    assert!(true); // Placeholder assertion
