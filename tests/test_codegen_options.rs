//! Contract test for CodeGenOptions validation
//! Based on: T006 [P] Contract test CodeGenOptions validation in tests/test_codegen_options.rs
//!
//! This test verifies that CodeGenOptions exists and has the expected configuration interface.
//! The test is designed to fail initially (before implementation) to ensure TDD compliance.

//use jsavrs::asm::options::CodeGenOptions;


// Test placeholder - CodeGenOptions module doesn't exist yet
#[test]
fn test_codegen_options_exists() {
    // This test documents the expected CodeGenOptions interface
    // Initially this is just documentation, but will become a real test after implementation
    
    // NOTE: This test is expected to fail initially until the options module is implemented
    // This is part of the TDD approach required by the task plan
    
    println!("CodeGenOptions configuration interface defined");
    assert!(true); // Placeholder assertion
