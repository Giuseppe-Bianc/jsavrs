//! Snapshot test for macOS assembly output
//! Based on: T016 [P] Snapshot test macOS assembly output in tests/test_macos_assembly_snapshots.rs
//!
//! This test verifies that macOS assembly output matches expected snapshots.
//! The test is designed to fail initially (before implementation) to ensure TDD compliance.

//use jsavrs::asm::generator::AssemblyGenerator;

// Test placeholder - will test macOS assembly snapshots after implementation
#[test]
fn test_macos_assembly_snapshots() {
    // This test documents the expected snapshot testing behavior for macOS
    // It will use insta to verify that generated assembly matches expected output
    // This helps catch regressions in assembly generation
    
    // NOTE: This test is expected to fail initially until assembly generation works
    // This is part of the TDD approach required by the task plan
