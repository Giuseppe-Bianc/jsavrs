//! Integration test for memory operations and local variables
//! Based on: T010 [P] Integration test memory operations and local variables in tests/test_memory_operations.rs
//!
//! This test verifies that the assembly generator correctly handles memory operations and local variables.
//! The test is designed to fail initially (before implementation) to ensure TDD compliance.

//use jsavrs::asm::generator::AssemblyGenerator;

// Test placeholder - will test memory operations after implementation
#[test]
fn test_memory_operations() {
    // This test documents the expected memory operations behavior
    // It will verify that the generator correctly handles:
    // - Stack allocation for local variables
    // - Memory load/store operations
    // - Array access patterns
    // - Proper addressing modes
    
    // NOTE: This test is expected to fail initially until memory operations are implemented
    // This is part of the TDD approach required by the task plan
