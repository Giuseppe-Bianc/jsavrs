//! Snapshot test for Windows assembly output
//! Based on: T015 [P] Snapshot test Windows assembly output in tests/test_windows_assembly_snapshots.rs
//!
//! This test verifies that Windows assembly output matches expected snapshots.
//! The test is designed to fail initially (before implementation) to ensure TDD compliance.

// use jsavrs::asm::generator::AssemblyGenerator;

// Test placeholder - will test Windows assembly snapshots after implementation
#[test]
fn test_windows_assembly_snapshots() {
    // This test documents the expected snapshot testing behavior for Windows
    // It will use insta to verify that generated assembly matches expected output
    // This helps catch regressions in assembly generation
    
    // NOTE: This test is expected to fail initially until assembly generation works
    // This is part of the TDD approach required by the task plan
