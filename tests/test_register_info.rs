//! Contract test for RegisterInfo interface
//! Based on: T008 [P] Contract test RegisterInfo interface in tests/test_register_info.rs
//!
//! This test verifies that RegisterInfo trait exists and has the expected interface.
//! The test is designed to fail initially (before implementation) to ensure TDD compliance.

//use jsavrs::asm::register::RegisterInfo;

// Test placeholder - RegisterInfo trait doesn't exist yet
#[test]
fn test_register_info_exists() {
    // This test documents the expected RegisterInfo interface
    // Initially this is just documentation, but will become a real test after implementation
    
    // NOTE: This test is expected to fail initially until the register module is updated
    // This is part of the TDD approach required by the task plan
    
    println!("RegisterInfo interface defined");
    assert!(true); // Placeholder assertion
