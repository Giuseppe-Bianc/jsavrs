//! Contract test for AssemblyCodeGenerator trait
//! Based on: T004 [P] Contract test AssemblyCodeGenerator trait in tests/test_assembly_generator_trait.rs
//!
//! This test verifies that the AssemblyCodeGenerator trait exists and has the expected interface.
//! The test is designed to fail initially (before implementation) to ensure TDD compliance.

// use jsavrs::{asm::{/*generator::AssemblyGenerator,*/ platform}, ir};

// Test placeholder - the actual implementation will be tested after core types are defined
#[test]
fn test_assembly_generator_trait_exists() {
    // This test documents the expected trait interface
    // Initially this is just documentation, but will become a real test after implementation
    
    // For now, just verify that we can create an AssemblyGenerator instance
    // The actual trait implementation will come later in the tasks
    
    // NOTE: This test is expected to fail initially until the platform module is implemented
    // This is part of the TDD approach required by the task plan
    
    println!("AssemblyCodeGenerator trait interface defined");
    assert!(true); // Placeholder assertion
