//! Integration test for performance benchmarking
//! Based on: T013 [P] Integration test performance benchmarking in tests/test_performance_benchmark.rs
//!
//! This test verifies that the assembly generator meets performance requirements.
//! The test is designed to fail initially (before implementation) to ensure TDD compliance.

//use jsavrs::asm::generator::AssemblyGenerator;

// Test placeholder - will test performance after implementation
#[test]
fn test_performance_benchmark() {
    // This test documents the expected performance requirements
    // It will verify that:
    // - Assembly generation completes within 5 seconds for 10,000 IR instructions
    // - Memory usage stays within 2x IR size limit
    // - Generated code has acceptable performance characteristics
    
    // NOTE: This test is expected to fail initially until performance implementation is complete
    // This is part of the TDD approach required by the task plan
