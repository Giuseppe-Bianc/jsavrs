# jsavrs Constitution

## Core Principles

### Safety First
The project prioritizes memory safety and thread safety through Rust's ownership model, ensuring that all code adheres to strict safety guarantees that prevent entire classes of vulnerabilities commonly found in compilers implemented in less safe languages.

### Performance Excellence
We are committed to achieving optimal compilation speeds through efficient memory management, processor utilization, and advanced optimization techniques, leveraging Rust's zero-cost abstractions to deliver high-performance compilation.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
The compiler operates seamlessly across major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions, with support for different processor architectures, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the host environment.

### Modular Extensibility
The project follows a component-based architecture that enables developers to modify specific compilation phases, add support for new programming languages, or integrate specialized optimization passes without requiring extensive reengineering of the core system.

### Test-Driven Reliability
We maintain a comprehensive testing methodology that includes unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests, ensuring correctness, reliability, and performance across diverse scenarios and input conditions.

### Collaboration First
The jsavrs community values collaborative development where contributors work together to build a better compiler. We believe that diverse perspectives and skills lead to more innovative solutions and stronger code quality. All community members are encouraged to participate in discussions, code reviews, and knowledge sharing to foster a culture of collective growth.

### Respectful Communication
We maintain a respectful and inclusive environment where all participants feel valued and heard. Constructive feedback is welcomed, but personal attacks, harassment, or dismissive behavior will not be tolerated. We follow the Rust Code of Conduct and expect all community members to treat each other with dignity and professionalism.

### Shared Learning
The jsavrs project is committed to being a learning platform for developers at all skill levels. We encourage mentorship, knowledge sharing, and educational contributions. Documentation, examples, and clear explanations are as valuable as code contributions, and we celebrate efforts that help others grow their skills.

### Quality Through Community
We believe that quality emerges through community review, testing, and refinement. Every contribution, whether it's a bug fix, feature addition, or documentation improvement, is reviewed by peers to ensure it meets our standards. This collaborative approach ensures that our compiler remains reliable, performant, and maintainable.

### Transparency and Openness
All project decisions, discussions, and development activities happen in the open. We use public repositories, issue trackers, and communication channels to ensure that everyone can participate and understand how the project evolves. We document our rationales for major decisions to maintain accountability and enable community learning.

## Development Principles
All development efforts must align with our core principles of safety, performance, compatibility, extensibility, and reliability. These principles guide all technical decisions and implementation approaches.

## Code Quality Standards
All contributions must adhere to Rust community standards and idioms, be formatted with `cargo fmt`, pass `cargo clippy` checks with no warnings, and include comprehensive documentation for public APIs with rustdoc comments.

## Governance
All submissions undergo a thorough review process to ensure they align with the project's technical standards. Contributors must follow established coding standards, architectural patterns, and best practices. Comprehensive testing is required for all new functionality with appropriate unit and integration tests. Code must be formatted with `cargo fmt` and pass `cargo clippy` checks before submission. Pull requests must provide clear, comprehensive documentation of changes.
